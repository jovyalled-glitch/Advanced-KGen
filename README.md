# KGen Website (Relative Links)

This version uses **relative links** so it works on GitHub **Project Pages** (URL includes your repo name).

URLs:
- Home: `/index.html` (or the root of your Pages URL)
- Products: `/products.html`
- Hidden Admin: `/admin/hr-policy.html` (unlinked; `noindex`)

Deploy steps: same as before (Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → main / (root)).
