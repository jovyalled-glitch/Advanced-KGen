      7.2 Staff attendance
7.2.1 Employment – Hours of Work
Please note that the key policy guidance documents and routine procedures you need to read for this
section are:
• School Teachers Pay and Conditions Document
• Offer of employment
• Contract of Employment and subsequent agreed amendments
• Directed Time model – TMR and UPR teaching staff
• Overtime / out of hours work
What is contained within this handbook is a summary of the most commonly referred to points and is
not a replacement for the above documents, all of which staff need to be familiar with. Hours of
work are individual to each member of staff and the offer of employment and contract of
employment will outline the weekly hours for which each individual is paid.
7.2.2 Directed Time – Teaching Staff
This is the means by which the Executive Headteacher will direct how the 1265 hours for those on
teaching contracts will be worked over the 195-day period.
In line with the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document (STPCD) it is important to note that a
teacher must work such reasonable additional hours (outside the 1265) as may be necessary to
enable the effective discharge of the teacher’s professional duties. In particular, this includes
planning and preparing courses and lessons; and assessing, monitoring, recording and reporting on
the learning needs, progress and achievements of assigned pupils.
At the Holy Trinity school we do not determine how many of the additional hours referred to must
be worked or when these hours must be worked. We do expect all teaching colleagues to be
diligently professional and work with a spirit that upholds our school values.
For the year 2025-2026-2025 West Sussex have set a school calendar which allocates 195 days. The
Directed Time model for 2025-2026 and some guidance for part time staff is as below:
Directed Time Model for 2025-2026 Days/
Allocated Time Total Hours
Weeks
Registration/Assembly – Start of Day 190 days 25 minutes 79.17

NOTES:
• 190 days PA contact days with students
• 39 weeks PA = 38 weeks teaching + 1 week INSET
• *Where a teacher attends all 6 evenings, line manager is to make an adjustment elsewhere
in directed time. Where a teacher attends less than 5 evenings, line manager to allocate this
directed time according to departmental need e.g. to intervention
• ** The Thursday devolved day is recovered through 5 Thursday Training sessions each half
term (except the first half term) running 3:30pm to 4:40 pm.
• **The Friday devolved day (5 hours 50 minutes) is recovered through Research Groups
• *** Not all staff will be required for Sixth Form Open Evening – where not attending this
time should be added back into the spread sheet to be allocated elsewhere by the Leader of
Learning
• **** Year 9 Options Evening – no Core teachers will be required and therefore an additional
2.5 hours allocated time for Core subjects to Interventions in place of this. However, if a Core
Teacher is also a Year 9 tutor, then they WILL be required to attend and will NOT be available for
additional intervention
• *****All time is allocated for Year 6 Open Evening within the model. The next day is an
Inset day – this will start at the normal time of 08:35 am and be a full day.
• ******Directed time for end of year celebration event depends on year group – Tutors for
Y7-10 & 12 = Hawth; Tutors for Y11 = Graduation; Tutors for Y13 = End of year event. Those who
are not a tutor should discuss and agree which event they need to attend.
• *******Additional Tutor Meetings – it is recognised that there is a need for Tutors, on
occasions, to hold meetings with parents. This time is set aside to allow this under the direction of
the Pastoral Leaders. There is a process explained in the tutoring section of the handbook for
logging these meetings against this allocated time.
• Behaviour Detentions will be run on a Monday, Wednesday and Thursday and will be
staffed by two teachers on a rota basis. These detentions will follow on after restorative
conversations 3:25 pm to 4:00 pm. 40 minutes is allocated in the DT model per detention session
allowing 5 minutes to arrive before the students. Full-time and teachers on 0.8FTE will be allocated
3 sessions per year; teachers on 0.6FTE will be allocated 2 sessions per year; teachers on 0.4FTE will
be allocated 1 session per year.
• Communion is NOT directed time and therefore, whilst it appears on the calendar to ensure
the time is kept free to enable all those who wish to attend to do so, it is not counted in the DT
model. NO MEETINGS should ever be scheduled that clash with Communion
• Staff Leaving Event – occurs each term – directed time allocated through the early finish on
the last day of each term – students leave 12:40 pm and staff leave 1:25 pm = 2 hours of directed
time available to pay back for the staff leaving event
• Contingency - there is currently 4.5 hours contingency in this model
      7.2.2.1 DIRECTED TIME (DT) GUIDANCE – Teachers
AIMS
• to be fair and reasonable to all teaching staff (both part and full time and recognising that some
staff teach all or most year groups and some only a few year groups)
• to maximise the opportunities for staff to participate fully in school and professional life within the
restrictions their working hours may present
• to delegate some of the monitoring of aspects of DT to Leaders of Learning
      to recognise the need for work life balance while fully acknowledging the commitments of the
profession and to help teachers plan to meet their DT commitments
• to help all teaching staff address the relevant and most urgent priorities in discharging their
professional duties and commitments
• to respect the right of part time staff not to work on a non-working day other than by agreement
• to encourage active participation by part time staff and their Leaders of Learning / Subject Leaders
in planning for certain aspects of DT at the start of each academic year
• to encourage early planning by Areas of Learning and in school leads e.g. SLT, Year Leaders on how
they will resource whole school activities with sufficient staff throughout the year
• to give clarity on expectations under DT in certain common situations and address some of the
uncertainties that seem to exist
SCOPE
Teachers other than those who are paid on the Leadership scale (Executive Headteacher, Head of
School, Deputy Headteacher, Assistant Headteachers, SENDCo and members of the ESLT).
Summary
We are aware how committed many of our teaching staff are to discharging their professional duties.
We aim to allow everyone to have reasonable and equal opportunity to participate in all aspects of
school life and to undertake their professional duties. This guidance is, therefore, intended to provide
clarity for both part-time staff and full-time staff. The guidance is not intended to cover every aspect
of the school’s typical DT model but rather aims to address areas where most queries have arisen.
The guidance has been prepared with the various requirements of the School Teachers Pay &
Conditions Document in mind. The intention is to help clarify preferences and expectations so that we
might aim for a position that reflects balance between prioritising the discharge of professional duties
and meeting the commitment to the relevant proportion of DT (dependent on the percentage of a full-
time post worked), whilst respecting that some staff have days on which they cannot be required to
work.
It is recognised that there are occasions where part-time staff offer to over commit on DT related
activities (through their own choice and in agreement with their leader) due to conflicting priorities.
An example of this would be where they attend more Parents Evenings than their adjusted time allows.
Where this over commitment is to the benefit of the students, and where the LoL has agreed that it is
important for the school, the school will use Time in Lieu (TOIL) to compensate for the additional time
worked. Prior agreement for such arrangements is required via the Leader of Learning and SLT Link,
and a paper trail including the HR Manager is required. TOIL will be taken at a mutually convenient
time and no later than the summer term of the same academic year. Accrued TOIL should be no more
than 1 full day at any one time. It should be noted that TOIL will not be available for additional activities
undertaken by the part time member of staff if this has not been agreed in advance.
Priorities (other than Registration/Duties/Teaching Time/Supervisory duties, etc. which are self-
explanatory) that appear to need some clarification include:
• INSET
• Parents Evenings
• Other Key School events e.g. Open Evenings, Celebration Events
      7.2.2.2 DIRECTED TIME HOURS
For a fulltime member of staff DT is 1265 hours. These hours are allocated reasonably across the days
that the teacher is required to be available to work during the school year. The school’s DT model is
an indication of how that time is typically distributed. Part time staff will work the relevant proportion
of 1265 e.g. 0.6 FTE will work 60% i.e. 759 hours. The percentage is applied to the total number of
hours rather than individual elements that make up that total.
Part-time teachers cannot be required to be available for work on any day which they do not usually
work but may do so with prior mutual agreement and offset such against their total DT commitment.
      7.2.2.3 RECORDING OF DIRECTED TIME BY LEADERS OF LEARNING
It is a requirement that all Leaders of Learning complete, for everyone in their team, the ‘Staffing for
Key DT Events 2025-2026 which is held on the one drive and shared with relevant staff. A copy of this
document can be found at Appendix 1. This should form part of a discussion at the start of the
academic year, especially for part time staff where priorities need to be set against available directed
time. It is also the means by which availability of staff for interventions is identified and recorded. It is
likely that it will require updating during the year and should include the recording of any agreed time
in lieu. It will be initially reviewed in line management at the end of September and again at the mid-
point and the end of the year. Please note that where staff work across more than one Area of Learning
the record is held within their main area, and other areas need to negotiate with that Leader of
Learning – e.g. if some hours of intervention are to be delivered in a second subject, then this must be
discussed and agreed in advance with the Leader of Learning for the main subject.
      7.2.2.4 INSET
• INSET attendance should be prioritised depending on content of the day and other more pressing
DT priorities
• It is preferred that all teaching staff attend on the first INSET day in the academic year and off set
against their DT. Alternatively, if it is anticipated that there will not be sufficient time to cover this,
then the additional day to attend the Inset can be claimed. This should be agreed in advance
through HR who will advise as to how this will be claimed.
7.2.2.5 Parents Evenings
• These are a top priority for all teaching staff
• Leaders of Learning and their teams should have professional conversation about managing
attendance at these events so that there is fair and equitable treatment across the school and so
that non-attendance can be accounted for and managed appropriately within a pre-agreed
arrangement. LoL will be held to account for all staffing arrangements at events
• It may be necessary for a teacher who does not teach a particular year group to still attend that
year group's parents evening to support colleagues and ensure that all parents have the
opportunity for a meeting. Furthermore, Leaders of Learning and Subject Leaders will need to
ensure that either they attend all relevant year groups for their subject, or they allocate to
another member of their team who is in attendance the lead role for the evening if there are
more general queries raised.
• Subject to other conflicting priorities tutors for the year group will prioritise attendance at these
even where they do not teach that year group. Offset all attendance against DT.
      Part time staff are encouraged to plan for prioritising all of these (where they teach the year group)
regardless of which day of the week they fall on. Attendance is offset against DT hours.
• The Leader of Learning will discuss and plan with all staff within their area at the start of the year
how their DT is to be used. This agreement will be recorded and a record throughout the year will
be kept ensuring the agreement has been fulfilled.
• Where attendance remains impossible for a part-time member of staff, they are directed to
arrange to contact parents and offer a different opportunity to talk about their child’s progress
after school on a normal working day. It may also be possible for the Leader of Learning to consider
briefing a full-time teacher to stand in on the evening.
• Where staff teach more than one class in a year group, they should prioritise Pupil Premium
Students and the most pressing student matters for a face-to-face meeting in the evening. In the
case of other families who require an opportunity to meet, they may be encouraged to do so by
phone or in person at another mutually convenient time. Attendance for alternative arrangements
may be offset against DT hours.
• Where staff are absent from school due to sickness on the day, they should provide all relevant
information to the Leader of Learning so that they might make arrangements for other staff to be
available to speak to parents with scheduled appointments. If for staffing/ knowledge reasons this
is not possible, staff are requested to contact parents and offer a different opportunity to talk
about their child’s progress after school on a normal working day. Offset against DT.
7.2.2.6 Open Evenings (Year 6 and 6th form)
• Required attendance for all full-time staff. Although in the case of the 6th form evening it is
recognised that much of the internal marketing foundation work will have been laid through quality
of teaching and enthusiasm for subject at KS4, attendance remains vitally important.
• For part-time staff which of these two evenings has greater priority will depend on the age group(s)
they teach. This should be discussed and agreed with the LoL. (See next point)
• Leaders of Learning and their teams should have professional conversation about managing
attendance at these events so that there is fair and equitable treatment across the school and so
that non-attendance can be accounted for and managed appropriately within a pre-agreed
arrangement. LoL will be held to account for all staffing arrangements at events and will record this.
• Leaders of Learning need to ensure the area is properly staffed so that the team can maximise on
this marketing opportunity while ensuring they facilitate the balancing of priorities for our part time
staff.
7.2.2.7 Interventions
Time is built into the DT model for interventions. It is important that these are planned at the start of
the year with the Leader of Learning with the time allocated through this model. This information will
need regularly updating to reflect the interventions delivered. These will run from 3:30 to 4:30 pm.
Where interventions would also benefit from being delivered in the holidays, the DT can be used.
Additional pay for interventions in the holidays, where available, will only be offered when all the
intervention time held in the DT model has already been used.
      7.2.3 Support staff
Working hours are as directed by the Executive Headteacher at the point of offer of employment and
up to the weekly hour’s limit for which the support member of staff has been employed.
7.2.4 inVentry electronic signing in and out system
All staff are expected to sign in on arrival at school via the ‘inVentry Electronic System’ positioned in
reception, adjacent to the Meeting Room (G105), in the medical and attendance room and the ground
floor of the Young Building. There is also an inVentry Anywhere App which can be used; however, the
app was removed from the App store on 31st October 2023 and there are no plans for its return. If you
already have it installed, you can continue to use it. However, if it is not installed, it cannot be obtained
or installed. At the end of the school day all staff are expected to sign out on the same system. If you
leave the school for an approved meeting, break or appointment then you must sign out and back in
on return.
7.2.5 Punctuality
Staff should model the high standard of punctuality we expect from students. All staff will be expected
to arrive on time for the start of the school day and for lessons and activities throughout the course of
the day.
The school day starts at 08:45 and ends at 15:10. We require full-time teaching staff to be on site by
08:35 and remain on site until 15:25.
If you must go offsite at any time during the day for any reason other than at the end of your normal
working hours, please notify your line manager and sign out using inVentry at the Main Reception. If
you are returning, we require you to sign back in. This is an essential part of the Health and Safety
Procedures.
Staff should ensure that lessons start and finish on time. Please do not delay students from moving on
to their next lesson unless there is an urgent need to do so.
7.3 Staff absence
Please note that the key policy guidance documents and routine procedures you need to read for this
section are listed below. Policies are available in the All Staff Team: Policies
• Reporting sickness absence
• Cover work
• Sickness Absence Policy
• Return to work notification process
• Occupational Health referral
• Employee Assistance Programme
• Discretionary Leave
• Dependency Leave
• Maternity Leave - Support Staff
• Maternity Policy - Teachers
• Paternity Leave - Teaching Staff
• Paternity Leave - Support Staff
• Parental Leave
      Holiday allowance (AYR staff)
The contents of this handbook provide a summary of the most frequently referenced points and do
not replace the aforementioned documents, which all staff need to be familiar with. In the event of
staff absence, teaching staff will be covered on a day-to-day basis by the cover team.
All absence request forms are now digital and a link to access these is on the top banner within the All
Staff Team (see screen shot in 7.10.3 for Orders – the absence form will be in the same location)– each
one has a training video attached.
7.3.1 Unplanned absence
      It is recognised that, because of the working hours of others, such appointments are, occasionally,
unavoidable. However, it should be borne in mind that many of these services are now accessible in
the evenings and at weekends and that, normally, all staff should be able to arrange appointments
which do not interrupt the school day.
If it is felt appropriate to grant absence for an appointment during normal working hours:
• In the case of a teacher there should be no disruption to normal teaching, unless satisfactory
internal cover is arranged by the teacher at no cost to the school
• Support staff would normally be expected to make up the time
There may be a variety of situations where employees will need time off for medical purposes and the
general intention is to accommodate reasonable requests for such time off. Reference should be made
to the paragraph above. All requests must be made in writing to the Head of School / HR Manager,
giving reasonable notice.
Routine Appointments
Where practical, employees should make routine appointments for the doctor/dental/hospital, etc.
outside of working hours, where this is not practical, reasonable paid time off will be approved.
Cancer Screening
Paid time off will be permitted for the purpose of cancer screening.
To request an absence, staff must submit an absence form electronically. Please ensure you follow the
instructions.
Should you require further information please refer to the STAFF Discretionary leave policy in the All-
Staff Team. Policies
7.3.4 Planned absence for compassionate reasons
A certain amount of discretionary leave is allowed on compassionate grounds; for example,
attending funerals of close relatives or friends or compassionate leave for other urgent personal
issues. Requests for this type of leave will be looked on sympathetically by the Head of School within
the guidelines set down by our Absence & Leave Policies, providing the correct procedures are
followed. Policies
Unpaid leave can occasionally be granted at the Head of School’s discretion.
7.3.5 Planned absence to attend courses
Where the planned absence is for courses then the approval is overseen by the AHT Learning and
Teaching in consultation with HR and the cover teams. Requests for courses are made via Absence
Request Form. If cover is available, cover requirements are noted, and no further action is necessary
other than setting work for the period you are absent. If cover is not available this will be commented
back on your form. If appropriate, staff will be offered the option to seek alternative, internal cover,
but if this is not possible to arrange the course application will usually be declined.
Please note that if you are absent from school for more than 3 weeks for any reason, we may require
school equipment e.g. laptops and keys to be returned so that they may be used by any staff replacing
you for the duration of your absence.
If you are unable to be in school for any reason and have been unable to give notice of this beforehand,
you must phone the Absence Reporting Hotline 01293 652970.
All calls to the absence line, including teaching staff and those with timetabled responsibilities, must
be placed before 7.30am on the morning of your absence. Please do not leave it later than this, unless
there is an emergency, as cover needs to be arranged. In addition to calling the absence line staff
should inform their Leader of Learning or Line Manager.
Teaching staff are required to set work for all classes during any period of absence. Details of cover
work must not be left on the answerphone when you call the absence reporting hotline. See section
5.6 of this handbook for details regarding the setting of cover work.
If the circumstances of an unplanned absence change, such as improving or worsening weather; train
delays or cancellations; traffic accidents, etc., updates should be provided throughout the day to
reflect the most current status.
7.3.2 Planned absence
In all cases you must consult with your Leader of Learning (Teaching staff) or Line Manager (Support
staff) before arranging any planned absence and before making a formal request. All requests for
planned absences or ‘keep free’ time MUST be made via the electronic online absence request form.
All forms, once submitted to Cover, are sent to the Head of School for approval.
The link to this electronic form is <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/81fef3a6-72aa-4648-a763-de824aeafb7d/_djb2_msteams_prefix_271191390?context=%7B%22channelId%22%3A%2219%3A4cd84b20e30c4a5a9833a99680cba972%40thread.tacv2%22%7D&tenantId=6cb466a9-2c53-4d33-b743-fe244531ed8f" target="_blank">Absence request form
</a>

Requests for exceptional absences e.g. a request for absence in term time, a longer-term absence for
medical needs, special leave for family issues, jury service, etc. would require an appointment to be
made with the Head of School to discuss prior to submission of your absence request.
In all cases of planned absence, it is important you give plenty of notice. You need to submit requests
for planned cover at least two weeks in advance, in all but emergencies. Requests for unpaid leave,
for example, to attend a family function, must be made at least a month in advance. We cannot
guarantee we will be able to accommodate requests.
To request an absence, staff must submit an absence request electronically as explained above. To
avoid disappointment, please ensure you follow the instructions.
7.3.3 Planned absence for personal, medical, or other meetings
Absences for appointments during normal working hours are at the discretion of the Head of School
who delegates routine matters to the HR Manager. Normally, staff should not make appointments
during work time – particularly where this may cause disruption and/or require cover to be arranged.
