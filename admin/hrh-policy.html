      7.2 Staff attendance
7.2.1 Employment – Hours of Work
Please note that the key policy guidance documents and routine procedures you need to read for this
section are:
• School Teachers Pay and Conditions Document
• Offer of employment
• Contract of Employment and subsequent agreed amendments
• Directed Time model – TMR and UPR teaching staff
• Overtime / out of hours work
What is contained within this handbook is a summary of the most commonly referred to points and is
not a replacement for the above documents, all of which staff need to be familiar with. Hours of
work are individual to each member of staff and the offer of employment and contract of
employment will outline the weekly hours for which each individual is paid.
7.2.2 Directed Time – Teaching Staff
This is the means by which the Executive Headteacher will direct how the 1265 hours for those on
teaching contracts will be worked over the 195-day period.
In line with the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document (STPCD) it is important to note that a
teacher must work such reasonable additional hours (outside the 1265) as may be necessary to
enable the effective discharge of the teacher’s professional duties. In particular, this includes
planning and preparing courses and lessons; and assessing, monitoring, recording and reporting on
the learning needs, progress and achievements of assigned pupils.
At the Holy Trinity school we do not determine how many of the additional hours referred to must
be worked or when these hours must be worked. We do expect all teaching colleagues to be
diligently professional and work with a spirit that upholds our school values.
For the year 2025-2026-2025 West Sussex have set a school calendar which allocates 195 days. The
Directed Time model for 2025-2026 and some guidance for part time staff is as below:
