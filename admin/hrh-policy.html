STAFF PROCEDURES & EMPLOYMENT DETAILS
7.1 Staff Recruitment
7.1.1 Introduction
Good recruitment is vital for every organisation - finding the right people for the right roles at the

      7.2 Staff attendance
7.2.1 Employment – Hours of Work
Please note that the key policy guidance documents and routine procedures you need to read for this
section are:
• School Teachers Pay and Conditions Document
• Offer of employment
• Contract of Employment and subsequent agreed amendments
• Directed Time model – TMR and UPR teaching staff
• Overtime / out of hours work
What is contained within this handbook is a summary of the most commonly referred to points and is
not a replacement for the above documents, all of which staff need to be familiar with. Hours of
work are individual to each member of staff and the offer of employment and contract of
employment will outline the weekly hours for which each individual is paid.
7.2.2 Directed Time – Teaching Staff
This is the means by which the Executive Headteacher will direct how the 1265 hours for those on
teaching contracts will be worked over the 195-day period.
In line with the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document (STPCD) it is important to note that a
teacher must work such reasonable additional hours (outside the 1265) as may be necessary to
enable the effective discharge of the teacher’s professional duties. In particular, this includes
planning and preparing courses and lessons; and assessing, monitoring, recording and reporting on
the learning needs, progress and achievements of assigned pupils.
At the Holy Trinity school we do not determine how many of the additional hours referred to must
be worked or when these hours must be worked. We do expect all teaching colleagues to be
diligently professional and work with a spirit that upholds our school values.
For the year 2025-2026-2025 West Sussex have set a school calendar which allocates 195 days. The
Directed Time model for 2025-2026 and some guidance for part time staff is as below:
Directed Time Model for 2025-2026 Days/
Allocated Time Total Hours

NOTES:
• 190 days PA contact days with students
• 39 weeks PA = 38 weeks teaching + 1 week INSET
• *Where a teacher attends all 6 evenings, line manager is to make an adjustment elsewhere
in directed time. Where a teacher attends less than 5 evenings, line manager to allocate this
directed time according to departmental need e.g. to intervention
• ** The Thursday devolved day is recovered through 5 Thursday Training sessions each half
term (except the first half term) running 3:30pm to 4:40 pm.
• **The Friday devolved day (5 hours 50 minutes) is recovered through Research Groups
• *** Not all staff will be required for Sixth Form Open Evening – where not attending this
time should be added back into the spread sheet to be allocated elsewhere by the Leader of
Learning
• **** Year 9 Options Evening – no Core teachers will be required and therefore an additional
2.5 hours allocated time for Core subjects to Interventions in place of this. However, if a Core
Teacher is also a Year 9 tutor, then they WILL be required to attend and will NOT be available for
additional intervention
• *****All time is allocated for Year 6 Open Evening within the model. The next day is an
Inset day – this will start at the normal time of 08:35 am and be a full day.
• ******Directed time for end of year celebration event depends on year group – Tutors for
Y7-10 & 12 = Hawth; Tutors for Y11 = Graduation; Tutors for Y13 = End of year event. Those who
are not a tutor should discuss and agree which event they need to attend.
• *******Additional Tutor Meetings – it is recognised that there is a need for Tutors, on
occasions, to hold meetings with parents. This time is set aside to allow this under the direction of
the Pastoral Leaders. There is a process explained in the tutoring section of the handbook for
logging these meetings against this allocated time.
• Behaviour Detentions will be run on a Monday, Wednesday and Thursday and will be
staffed by two teachers on a rota basis. These detentions will follow on after restorative
conversations 3:25 pm to 4:00 pm. 40 minutes is allocated in the DT model per detention session
allowing 5 minutes to arrive before the students. Full-time and teachers on 0.8FTE will be allocated
3 sessions per year; teachers on 0.6FTE will be allocated 2 sessions per year; teachers on 0.4FTE will
be allocated 1 session per year.
• Communion is NOT directed time and therefore, whilst it appears on the calendar to ensure
the time is kept free to enable all those who wish to attend to do so, it is not counted in the DT
model. NO MEETINGS should ever be scheduled that clash with Communion
• Staff Leaving Event – occurs each term – directed time allocated through the early finish on
the last day of each term – students leave 12:40 pm and staff leave 1:25 pm = 2 hours of directed
time available to pay back for the staff leaving event
• Contingency - there is currently 4.5 hours contingency in this model
      7.2.2.1 DIRECTED TIME (DT) GUIDANCE – Teachers
AIMS
• to be fair and reasonable to all teaching staff (both part and full time and recognising that some
staff teach all or most year groups and some only a few year groups)
• to maximise the opportunities for staff to participate fully in school and professional life within the
restrictions their working hours may present
• to delegate some of the monitoring of aspects of DT to Leaders of Learning
      to recognise the need for work life balance while fully acknowledging the commitments of the
profession and to help teachers plan to meet their DT commitments
• to help all teaching staff address the relevant and most urgent priorities in discharging their
professional duties and commitments
• to respect the right of part time staff not to work on a non-working day other than by agreement
• to encourage active participation by part time staff and their Leaders of Learning / Subject Leaders
in planning for certain aspects of DT at the start of each academic year
• to encourage early planning by Areas of Learning and in school leads e.g. SLT, Year Leaders on how
they will resource whole school activities with sufficient staff throughout the year
• to give clarity on expectations under DT in certain common situations and address some of the
uncertainties that seem to exist
SCOPE
Teachers other than those who are paid on the Leadership scale (Executive Headteacher, Head of
School, Deputy Headteacher, Assistant Headteachers, SENDCo and members of the ESLT).
Summary
We are aware how committed many of our teaching staff are to discharging their professional duties.
We aim to allow everyone to have reasonable and equal opportunity to participate in all aspects of
school life and to undertake their professional duties. This guidance is, therefore, intended to provide
clarity for both part-time staff and full-time staff. The guidance is not intended to cover every aspect
of the school’s typical DT model but rather aims to address areas where most queries have arisen.
The guidance has been prepared with the various requirements of the School Teachers Pay &
Conditions Document in mind. The intention is to help clarify preferences and expectations so that we
might aim for a position that reflects balance between prioritising the discharge of professional duties
and meeting the commitment to the relevant proportion of DT (dependent on the percentage of a full-
time post worked), whilst respecting that some staff have days on which they cannot be required to
work.
It is recognised that there are occasions where part-time staff offer to over commit on DT related
activities (through their own choice and in agreement with their leader) due to conflicting priorities.
An example of this would be where they attend more Parents Evenings than their adjusted time allows.
Where this over commitment is to the benefit of the students, and where the LoL has agreed that it is
important for the school, the school will use Time in Lieu (TOIL) to compensate for the additional time
worked. Prior agreement for such arrangements is required via the Leader of Learning and SLT Link,
and a paper trail including the HR Manager is required. TOIL will be taken at a mutually convenient
time and no later than the summer term of the same academic year. Accrued TOIL should be no more
than 1 full day at any one time. It should be noted that TOIL will not be available for additional activities
undertaken by the part time member of staff if this has not been agreed in advance.
Priorities (other than Registration/Duties/Teaching Time/Supervisory duties, etc. which are self-
explanatory) that appear to need some clarification include:
• INSET
• Parents Evenings
• Other Key School events e.g. Open Evenings, Celebration Events
      7.2.2.2 DIRECTED TIME HOURS
For a fulltime member of staff DT is 1265 hours. These hours are allocated reasonably across the days
that the teacher is required to be available to work during the school year. The school’s DT model is
an indication of how that time is typically distributed. Part time staff will work the relevant proportion
of 1265 e.g. 0.6 FTE will work 60% i.e. 759 hours. The percentage is applied to the total number of
hours rather than individual elements that make up that total.
Part-time teachers cannot be required to be available for work on any day which they do not usually
work but may do so with prior mutual agreement and offset such against their total DT commitment.
      7.2.2.3 RECORDING OF DIRECTED TIME BY LEADERS OF LEARNING
It is a requirement that all Leaders of Learning complete, for everyone in their team, the ‘Staffing for
Key DT Events 2025-2026 which is held on the one drive and shared with relevant staff. A copy of this
document can be found at Appendix 1. This should form part of a discussion at the start of the
academic year, especially for part time staff where priorities need to be set against available directed
time. It is also the means by which availability of staff for interventions is identified and recorded. It is
likely that it will require updating during the year and should include the recording of any agreed time
in lieu. It will be initially reviewed in line management at the end of September and again at the mid-
point and the end of the year. Please note that where staff work across more than one Area of Learning
the record is held within their main area, and other areas need to negotiate with that Leader of
Learning – e.g. if some hours of intervention are to be delivered in a second subject, then this must be
discussed and agreed in advance with the Leader of Learning for the main subject.
      7.2.2.4 INSET
• INSET attendance should be prioritised depending on content of the day and other more pressing
DT priorities
• It is preferred that all teaching staff attend on the first INSET day in the academic year and off set
against their DT. Alternatively, if it is anticipated that there will not be sufficient time to cover this,
then the additional day to attend the Inset can be claimed. This should be agreed in advance
through HR who will advise as to how this will be claimed.
7.2.2.5 Parents Evenings
• These are a top priority for all teaching staff
• Leaders of Learning and their teams should have professional conversation about managing
attendance at these events so that there is fair and equitable treatment across the school and so
that non-attendance can be accounted for and managed appropriately within a pre-agreed
arrangement. LoL will be held to account for all staffing arrangements at events
• It may be necessary for a teacher who does not teach a particular year group to still attend that
year group's parents evening to support colleagues and ensure that all parents have the
opportunity for a meeting. Furthermore, Leaders of Learning and Subject Leaders will need to
ensure that either they attend all relevant year groups for their subject, or they allocate to
another member of their team who is in attendance the lead role for the evening if there are
more general queries raised.
• Subject to other conflicting priorities tutors for the year group will prioritise attendance at these
even where they do not teach that year group. Offset all attendance against DT.
      Part time staff are encouraged to plan for prioritising all of these (where they teach the year group)
regardless of which day of the week they fall on. Attendance is offset against DT hours.
• The Leader of Learning will discuss and plan with all staff within their area at the start of the year
how their DT is to be used. This agreement will be recorded and a record throughout the year will
be kept ensuring the agreement has been fulfilled.
• Where attendance remains impossible for a part-time member of staff, they are directed to
arrange to contact parents and offer a different opportunity to talk about their child’s progress
after school on a normal working day. It may also be possible for the Leader of Learning to consider
briefing a full-time teacher to stand in on the evening.
• Where staff teach more than one class in a year group, they should prioritise Pupil Premium
Students and the most pressing student matters for a face-to-face meeting in the evening. In the
case of other families who require an opportunity to meet, they may be encouraged to do so by
phone or in person at another mutually convenient time. Attendance for alternative arrangements
may be offset against DT hours.
• Where staff are absent from school due to sickness on the day, they should provide all relevant
information to the Leader of Learning so that they might make arrangements for other staff to be
available to speak to parents with scheduled appointments. If for staffing/ knowledge reasons this
is not possible, staff are requested to contact parents and offer a different opportunity to talk
about their child’s progress after school on a normal working day. Offset against DT.
7.2.2.6 Open Evenings (Year 6 and 6th form)
• Required attendance for all full-time staff. Although in the case of the 6th form evening it is
recognised that much of the internal marketing foundation work will have been laid through quality
of teaching and enthusiasm for subject at KS4, attendance remains vitally important.
• For part-time staff which of these two evenings has greater priority will depend on the age group(s)
they teach. This should be discussed and agreed with the LoL. (See next point)
• Leaders of Learning and their teams should have professional conversation about managing
attendance at these events so that there is fair and equitable treatment across the school and so
that non-attendance can be accounted for and managed appropriately within a pre-agreed
arrangement. LoL will be held to account for all staffing arrangements at events and will record this.
• Leaders of Learning need to ensure the area is properly staffed so that the team can maximise on
this marketing opportunity while ensuring they facilitate the balancing of priorities for our part time
staff.
7.2.2.7 Interventions
Time is built into the DT model for interventions. It is important that these are planned at the start of
the year with the Leader of Learning with the time allocated through this model. This information will
need regularly updating to reflect the interventions delivered. These will run from 3:30 to 4:30 pm.
Where interventions would also benefit from being delivered in the holidays, the DT can be used.
Additional pay for interventions in the holidays, where available, will only be offered when all the
intervention time held in the DT model has already been used.
      7.2.3 Support staff
Working hours are as directed by the Executive Headteacher at the point of offer of employment and
up to the weekly hour’s limit for which the support member of staff has been employed.
7.2.4 inVentry electronic signing in and out system
All staff are expected to sign in on arrival at school via the ‘inVentry Electronic System’ positioned in
reception, adjacent to the Meeting Room (G105), in the medical and attendance room and the ground
floor of the Young Building. There is also an inVentry Anywhere App which can be used; however, the
app was removed from the App store on 31st October 2023 and there are no plans for its return. If you
already have it installed, you can continue to use it. However, if it is not installed, it cannot be obtained
or installed. At the end of the school day all staff are expected to sign out on the same system. If you
leave the school for an approved meeting, break or appointment then you must sign out and back in
on return.
7.2.5 Punctuality
Staff should model the high standard of punctuality we expect from students. All staff will be expected
to arrive on time for the start of the school day and for lessons and activities throughout the course of
the day.
The school day starts at 08:45 and ends at 15:10. We require full-time teaching staff to be on site by
08:35 and remain on site until 15:25.
If you must go offsite at any time during the day for any reason other than at the end of your normal
working hours, please notify your line manager and sign out using inVentry at the Main Reception. If
you are returning, we require you to sign back in. This is an essential part of the Health and Safety
Procedures.
Staff should ensure that lessons start and finish on time. Please do not delay students from moving on
to their next lesson unless there is an urgent need to do so.
7.3 Staff absence
Please note that the key policy guidance documents and routine procedures you need to read for this
section are listed below. Policies are available in the All Staff Team: Policies
• Reporting sickness absence
• Cover work
• Sickness Absence Policy
• Return to work notification process
• Occupational Health referral
• Employee Assistance Programme
• Discretionary Leave
• Dependency Leave
• Maternity Leave - Support Staff
• Maternity Policy - Teachers
• Paternity Leave - Teaching Staff
• Paternity Leave - Support Staff
• Parental Leave
      Holiday allowance (AYR staff)
The contents of this handbook provide a summary of the most frequently referenced points and do
not replace the aforementioned documents, which all staff need to be familiar with. In the event of
staff absence, teaching staff will be covered on a day-to-day basis by the cover team.
All absence request forms are now digital and a link to access these is on the top banner within the All
Staff Team (see screen shot in 7.10.3 for Orders – the absence form will be in the same location)– each
one has a training video attached.
7.3.1 Unplanned absence
      It is recognised that, because of the working hours of others, such appointments are, occasionally,
unavoidable. However, it should be borne in mind that many of these services are now accessible in
the evenings and at weekends and that, normally, all staff should be able to arrange appointments
which do not interrupt the school day.
If it is felt appropriate to grant absence for an appointment during normal working hours:
• In the case of a teacher there should be no disruption to normal teaching, unless satisfactory
internal cover is arranged by the teacher at no cost to the school
• Support staff would normally be expected to make up the time
There may be a variety of situations where employees will need time off for medical purposes and the
general intention is to accommodate reasonable requests for such time off. Reference should be made
to the paragraph above. All requests must be made in writing to the Head of School / HR Manager,
giving reasonable notice.
Routine Appointments
Where practical, employees should make routine appointments for the doctor/dental/hospital, etc.
outside of working hours, where this is not practical, reasonable paid time off will be approved.
Cancer Screening
Paid time off will be permitted for the purpose of cancer screening.
To request an absence, staff must submit an absence form electronically. Please ensure you follow the
instructions.
Should you require further information please refer to the STAFF Discretionary leave policy in the All-
Staff Team. Policies
7.3.4 Planned absence for compassionate reasons
A certain amount of discretionary leave is allowed on compassionate grounds; for example,
attending funerals of close relatives or friends or compassionate leave for other urgent personal
issues. Requests for this type of leave will be looked on sympathetically by the Head of School within
the guidelines set down by our Absence & Leave Policies, providing the correct procedures are
followed. Policies
Unpaid leave can occasionally be granted at the Head of School’s discretion.
7.3.5 Planned absence to attend courses
Where the planned absence is for courses then the approval is overseen by the AHT Learning and
Teaching in consultation with HR and the cover teams. Requests for courses are made via Absence
Request Form. If cover is available, cover requirements are noted, and no further action is necessary
other than setting work for the period you are absent. If cover is not available this will be commented
back on your form. If appropriate, staff will be offered the option to seek alternative, internal cover,
but if this is not possible to arrange the course application will usually be declined.
Please note that if you are absent from school for more than 3 weeks for any reason, we may require
school equipment e.g. laptops and keys to be returned so that they may be used by any staff replacing
you for the duration of your absence.
If you are unable to be in school for any reason and have been unable to give notice of this beforehand,
you must phone the Absence Reporting Hotline 01293 652970.
All calls to the absence line, including teaching staff and those with timetabled responsibilities, must
be placed before 7.30am on the morning of your absence. Please do not leave it later than this, unless
there is an emergency, as cover needs to be arranged. In addition to calling the absence line staff
should inform their Leader of Learning or Line Manager.
Teaching staff are required to set work for all classes during any period of absence. Details of cover
work must not be left on the answerphone when you call the absence reporting hotline. See section
5.6 of this handbook for details regarding the setting of cover work.
If the circumstances of an unplanned absence change, such as improving or worsening weather; train
delays or cancellations; traffic accidents, etc., updates should be provided throughout the day to
reflect the most current status.
7.3.2 Planned absence
In all cases you must consult with your Leader of Learning (Teaching staff) or Line Manager (Support
staff) before arranging any planned absence and before making a formal request. All requests for
planned absences or ‘keep free’ time MUST be made via the electronic online absence request form.
All forms, once submitted to Cover, are sent to the Head of School for approval.
The link to this electronic form is <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/81fef3a6-72aa-4648-a763-de824aeafb7d/_djb2_msteams_prefix_271191390?context=%7B%22channelId%22%3A%2219%3A4cd84b20e30c4a5a9833a99680cba972%40thread.tacv2%22%7D&tenantId=6cb466a9-2c53-4d33-b743-fe244531ed8f" target="_blank">Absence request form
</a>

Requests for exceptional absences e.g. a request for absence in term time, a longer-term absence for
medical needs, special leave for family issues, jury service, etc. would require an appointment to be
made with the Head of School to discuss prior to submission of your absence request.
In all cases of planned absence, it is important you give plenty of notice. You need to submit requests
for planned cover at least two weeks in advance, in all but emergencies. Requests for unpaid leave,
for example, to attend a family function, must be made at least a month in advance. We cannot
guarantee we will be able to accommodate requests.
To request an absence, staff must submit an absence request electronically as explained above. To
avoid disappointment, please ensure you follow the instructions.
7.3.3 Planned absence for personal, medical, or other meetings
Absences for appointments during normal working hours are at the discretion of the Head of School
who delegates routine matters to the HR Manager. Normally, staff should not make appointments
during work time – particularly where this may cause disruption and/or require cover to be arranged.
7.3.6 Planned absence to attend an interview
Where the planned absence is to attend an interview then the approval will be given by the Head of
School, and you should discuss your request with the Head of School prior to submitting an absence
request electronically. You will already, as a matter of courtesy, have informed the Head of School,
your Leader of Learning and line manager that you are intending to apply for a post outside of the
school. After 5 days of interviews, it is at the Head of School’s discretion as to whether any subsequent
days are paid or not. Only Interviews within Education are paid.
7.3.7 Absent when you have a duty commitment
If you know in advance that you will be out of school, it is your responsibility to arrange a duty swap.
If you are ill, please mention duties when asking for cover so that the duty member of SLT can be
informed.
7.3.8 Return to work procedures & absence monitoring
All Staff sickness absence must be reported to WSCC Payroll. Following each period of sickness
absence, the employee and their line manager must have a “Return to work” conversation. This will
ideally be done face to face on the day the employee returns, if practical.
This may consist of a brief passing chat where there are no concerns or a more formal pre-arranged
conversation if there are concerns regarding absence levels, reason for absence, etc. Where triggers
are met, the meeting will also have a member of the HR Team.
Any triggers reached must be acted upon:
Trigger 1 – 4 absences in 4 months
Trigger 2 – 8 or more workdays in the last 12 months
Trigger 3 – longer term absence of more than 21 days.
See the STAFF Sickness Absence Policy on the All-Staff Team Policies for further details.
7.3.9 Leaving cover work for planned absence
When setting cover work for prearranged cover:
• Follow the plan – together with other key pieces of information - outlined in Section 5.6 of this
handbook
• The name of a member of the department to contact in case of emergency, and where to find
them
• The names of two or three reliable students who can be trusted to take messages
• Any additional information which may be useful, but avoid leaving confidential medical or
personal details about students on the sheet
• REACH lessons must be adapted for cover
• Practical lessons, e.g. Drama, are not appropriate to be left for cover and an alternative
theoretical lesson should be provided. Drama lessons will be relocated into a conventional
classroom.
17
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook - Section 7 – September 2025
Staff who omit to follow these procedures cause real inconvenience to those who cover them – help
your colleagues to help you. Wherever possible, work should be set for classes, and you should use the
cover lesson template.
7.3.10 Occupational Health referral information for employees
The Occupational Health service (OH) is available to help managers, Headteachers and employees to
manage medical conditions in the work environment. You may be referred to the OH after 21 days
absence or when it becomes known that your absence will be more than 21 days; if your attendance
is a cause for concern and/or if we need to seek advice to determine if and when you will be fit to
return to work on full duties, full-time work with short term adaptions, full-time work with long
term/permanent reasonable adjustment or on a phased return to work.
The OH Service is an advisory service only and provides medical advice to management and employees
with the intention of improving health or a work situation. Whilst every effort is made by management
to implement the suggestions, sometimes this may not be possible.
The OH provides the school with a number of services, including for example:
• Pre-employment medical screening for new employees (or in some cases for employees
transferring to new jobs)
• Assessing cases where ill health retirement or redeployment on the grounds of ill health are
necessary
• Advice to managers/headteachers on assessing an individual employee's fitness to return to
work after a serious illness or a prolonged sickness absence
• Advice to managers when planning a phased return to work and rehabilitation periods, if
applicable
• Advice on adjustments that could be made to an employee's post or to the workplace to assist
employees with disabilities
• Advice on preventative measures where employees are absent because of a work-related
illness or injury, for example back pain, repetitive strain injury
The OH is staffed by doctors and nurses qualified in occupational health. On being recruited, you will
be asked to complete a pre-employment health questionnaire and may be asked to attend for
appointment with one of the OH staff to clarify your medical history or current health condition before
you commence employment.
The Executive Headteacher, Head of School and HR Team can refer employees to OH throughout
employment to ensure employees are fit for work.
You cannot refer yourself to OH. If you are experiencing health problems which affect your work
performance, you are advised to consult your GP and let your line manager (in the first instance) know
that you are managing a health issue with your GP, who will make the request via the HR Team. Your
line manage, supported by the HR Team, will work with you and discuss the recommendations from
your GP/Consultant or Occupational Health report to make it easier for you to return and/or stay in
work.
If you are referred to OH at any time during your employment, you will receive an explanation of what
to expect. Referrals may be either a telephone consultation or sometimes a face-to-face consultation.

7.3.12 Leave of absence
Other types of leave that may occur during your employment might include maternity; paternity;
shared parental; dependency and compassionate leave. The school has policies covering all these
situations which you should make yourself familiar with and can access them in the All-Staff Teams.
Policies Alternatively, please refer to your line manager or the HR Team.
Dependency Leave – It has been mistakenly interpreted that an employee has an ‘allowance’ or
‘entitlement’ to take multiple days of paid leave to undertake childcare. Emergency leave for
dependents is granted on a one-day basis where the urgent organisation of ongoing care is required.
Section five of this policy is titled ‘Is dependency leave paid?’ and states that up to two hours will
normally be paid and thereafter would be unpaid.

7.4 Holiday allowance
7.4.1 Teachers and Term Time Only (TTO) Support Staff
You should ensure that you take your annual leave during the school holiday closure period as you may
not take annual leave during term time. The payment and period absent from work satisfies your
entitlement to statutory minimum annual leave.
7.4.2 Support Staff on All Year Round (AYR) contracts
Standard leave entitlement varies according to grade and continuous service and is outlined in your
contract of employment. Full details about annual leave are also included in the contract of
employment.
The annual leave period is from 1st April to 31st March. Staff starting or leaving employment during
the year are entitled to annual leave, proportionate to the number of completed month’s service
during the year.
Whilst leave can be taken in term time, dates must be agreed in advance with your line manager and
key dates must be avoided (e.g the start of September and other key dates).
N.B. Part-time Staff are entitled to annual leave pro-rata.
7.5 Employment matters

the school's policies and procedures about the employee’s performance and/or conduct. If such action
is proposed, the employee must be informed in advance and given the opportunity to appeal – through
either the grievance procedure or the disciplinary procedure, as appropriate. An increment which is
withheld may be paid subsequently (but not retrospectively) if the employee’s work becomes
satisfactory. It is recommended to make such reports by February to allow for any appeals to be heard
before increments are confirmed.

7.5.6 National Insurance
Employees are required by law to inform their employer of their National Insurance number. It is
essential to ensure that an employee's NI contributions are stored correctly with the HMRC, as these
determine state benefits such as a state retirement pension. If you do not have a National Insurance
Number, please make an appointment with your local Jobcentre Plus Office to apply for one.
7.5.7 Personnel number
Your personnel number can be found on your payslip. Please quote this whenever contacting HR Shared
Services, and on all correspondence to enable the prompt access of your personal records. For employees
who have more than one contract of employment, only one payslip will be issued. The personnel number
for the contract with greatest proportion of hours is usually quoted on the front of your payslip. Please
bear this in mind when completing Doc 33’s/35's, as the personnel number for the specific job on which casual
hours or overtime is being worked should be quoted to ensure the correct rate of pay.
7.5.8 Contact & queries
Please note that if you have any queries regarding your employment or salary payments the HR team in
school should be contacted in the first instance.
7.5.9 Support staff term time only working
For staff members who are contracted to work term-time only (TTO), in order for your salary to be paid
in 12 equal instalments, your salary is recalculated to account for non-working periods. Please note that
this recalculated salary will appear on your payslip together with the number of weeks your contract
is based upon e.g. 43 weeks (38 working weeks (at 37 hours per week) plus 5.2 weeks annual leave).
Example calculation:
A monthly salary payment on a full-time TTO annual salary of £19,053, based on 43.2 weeks will be shown
as £1,312.95.
£19,053/12 x 43/52 weeks = £1,319.05 per month
7.5.10 Leaving and term time recalculation – support staff

7.6 Staff professional values and codes of conduct
All staff members of Holy Trinity Church of England Secondary School are role models for the students.
It is therefore expected that staff are committed to demonstrating high professional and personal
standards. The following sets out the shared view of how staff should behave and conduct themselves
when carrying out all professional duties and roles.
7.6.1 Professional Values
Everyone’s contribution valued
At Holy Trinity Church of England Secondary School, we believe every member of staff is a valued
part of our Christian community. Staff are our most important asset, and we are committed to
nurturing positive, respectful, and professional relationships with all colleagues, students, parents,
and visitors.
Courtesy, dignity and respect for all
As a Church of England school, our values are rooted in respect for the dignity of every person. We
are committed to treating everyone with courtesy, fairness, and kindness, and to considering the
feelings and needs of others in all that we do.
Commitment to high standards and continuous improvement
We set ourselves high expectations, both professionally and personally, and are dedicated to the
success and flourishing of every student. We aim to avoid actions or comments which could
undermine the reputation of Holy Trinity or the trust placed in us by our community. Instead, we
seek to contribute positively to the culture of the school and its standing in the wider community.
Commitment to equality, diversity, and inclusion
We uphold equality of opportunity for all staff and students, ensuring that everyone is treated fairly
and with dignity. We value the diversity of our school community and celebrate the unique gifts each
person brings, in line with both our legal duties and our Christian ethos.
7.6.2 Code of Conduct
This Code of Conduct applies to all staff, both teaching and support, whether permanent, fixed-
term, casual, agency or volunteer. It does not cover every eventuality, but it sets out the
professional expectations that underpin our work at Holy Trinity Church of England Secondary
School. Its purpose is to:
• Protect students, staff, and the reputation of the school.
• Ensure fairness and consistency in how staff are managed.
• Provide clarity for line managers when addressing breaches of standards.
• Reflect our Christian ethos of respect, dignity, and service to others.
General Principles
• Staff must act with professionalism, honesty, and integrity at all times.
• All staff are expected to support the Christian ethos of the school and uphold its reputation
within the community.
• Staff are accountable for their conduct both within and outside of school where behaviour
could affect the school’s reputation or trust in their professional role.
• Breaches of this Code may be managed under the school’s disciplinary procedures.
26
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook - Section 7 – September 2025
Conduct in Relation to Students
• Professional Boundaries: Staff must maintain clear and appropriate boundaries with students
at all times. Over-familiarity, favouritism, or inappropriate personal relationships with
students are strictly prohibited.
• Language and Behaviour: Staff must use language and adopt behaviour that is respectful,
professional, and free from sarcasm, humiliation, intimidation, or sexual overtones.
Derogatory or discriminatory remarks are unacceptable.
• Physical Contact: Physical contact should be avoided unless necessary for safety, safeguarding,
or essential teaching purposes. Any unavoidable physical contact must be appropriate,
proportionate, and reported in line with safeguarding procedures.
• One-to-One Situations: Where possible, one-to-one meetings with students should take place
in visible spaces (e.g. rooms with open doors or clear panels). Meetings off site or outside
school hours must not take place without line manager approval.
• Transporting Students: Staff must not transport students in their own vehicles without prior
written permission from a senior leader and parental consent.
Safeguarding and Confidentiality
• Staff must comply fully with the school’s safeguarding and child protection policies.
• Information shared by students must never be promised confidentiality. Concerns must be
reported immediately to the Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL).
• Staff must never share confidential information about students, parents, or colleagues outside
of legitimate professional contexts.
Alcohol, Drugs, and Smoking
• Staff must not consume alcohol, smoke, vape, or use illegal substances during the school day
or when supervising students on trips, residentials, or evening events.
• Staff must not attend work under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or any other substance that
impairs performance.
• Smoking or vaping is not permitted on the school site or in its immediate vicinity.
Use of ICT, Phones, and Social Media
• Staff must not give students their personal phone numbers, social media details, or use
personal email accounts for school communication.
• Staff must not engage in online, text, or social media correspondence with students outside
official school systems.
• Staff must not make negative, inappropriate, or personal comments about students,
colleagues, parents, or the school on social media or in public forums.
• Personal mobile phones must not be used during teaching time or in frontline interaction with
students, except in emergencies or as part of official duties.
Use of Materials and Resources
• Teaching materials (films, videos, internet content) must be age-appropriate, suitable, and
respectful of the school’s Christian ethos and student diversity. Where content may be
sensitive, prior approval from a line manager is required.
• Staff must not bring inappropriate, offensive, or illegal materials onto school premises.
First Aid and Medication
• Staff administering first aid should ensure another adult is present wherever possible and keep
physical contact to the minimum necessary.
• Staff must not administer medication to students except where authorised by policy (e.g.
emergency use of EpiPen).
27
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook - Section 7 – September 2025
Relationships and Conduct Between Staff
• Staff must treat colleagues with courtesy, dignity, and respect at all times, avoiding gossip,
undermining, or unprofessional behaviour.
• Concerns about colleagues must be raised through appropriate channels, not with students or
parents.
• Violence, aggression, harassment, or bullying will not be tolerated under any circumstances
and will be treated as gross misconduct.
Professional Integrity
• Staff must declare any conflict of interest that may affect their role (e.g. relationships with
parents, students, or contractors).
• Staff must not misuse school property, resources, or time for personal gain.
• Staff must uphold confidentiality in HR, safeguarding, and personal matters.
Compliance with Policies
This Code of Conduct works alongside all other school policies including safeguarding, data
protection, health and safety, behaviour, and disciplinary procedures. Failure to adhere to this
Code may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, in line with employment law,
the School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions Document (STPCD), and the NJC terms and conditions.
7.6.3 Personal appearance
Staff are expected to dress in a professional and formal manner, modelling the high standards of
appearance we expect from students. Smart, professional dress supports our ethos as a Church of
England school and conveys respect for our community.
• For teaching and support staff, smart/formal dress is expected. Male staff should wear a shirt
and tie, and teachers may be required to wear a jacket at key events or at the direction of
the Head of School/Executive Headteacher.
• Practical subject staff (e.g. PE, Technology) should wear appropriate professional clothing
suitable for their role.
• Clothing should be modest and appropriate for a formal school environment. Denim, casual
wear, leggings, revealing tops, flip flops, trainers, and excessive jewellery are not permitted.
Tattoos should be covered.
• Reasonable adjustments will be made where necessary for disability, medical, cultural, or
religious reasons.
This dress code is intended to ensure consistency, professionalism, and respect for the school
environment.
7.6.4 Mobile phones
As part of maintaining professionalism and safeguarding standards, mobile phones and personal
media devices must not be used during teaching time or when interacting with students.
• Staff may use mobile phones in the Wellbeing House or staff offices, provided use does not
disturb colleagues or prevent hearing the fire alarm.
• Staff must not wear headphones while working alone, for safety reasons.
• The only exceptions are staff whose duties require phone use (e.g. On Call, premises staff,
trip leaders).
7.6.5 Chewing gum
To maintain professionalism and model expectations for students, staff must not chew gum during
lessons, meetings, or any interaction with students, parents/carers, or external visitors.
28
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook - Section 7 – September 2025
7.6.6 Smoking
Holy Trinity Church of England Secondary School is a smoke-free environment.
• It is against the law to smoke anywhere on the school premises.
• Staff must not smoke or vape in the area immediately surrounding the school grounds, as
this undermines the school’s professional and Christian ethos.
• Breaches of this requirement will be treated as a disciplinary matter.
7.6.7 Staff use of medical room and first aid
The medical room exists primarily for the care of students.
• Staff may only use the medical room in cases of serious accident or medical emergency.
• Staff are responsible for bringing any prescription or non-prescription medication they may
require during the school day.
• Staff may, if they wish, notify the HR Manager and medical room staff of any underlying
medical condition that could require urgent intervention (e.g. epilepsy, anaphylaxis). This
information will be treated confidentially.
• First aid provision for staff is available in line with health and safety regulations.
7.6.8 Expectations for Staff with Children in School
Staff who are also parents of children at Holy Trinity must manage this dual role with care, ensuring
professional boundaries are maintained and fairness is upheld.
Key expectations:
• Professional boundaries: Staff must not use their position to gain advantage for their child.
Appointments or meetings about their child should be arranged in the same way as for other
parents, outside of school working hours.
• Confidentiality and safeguarding: Staff must treat all students, including their child’s peers,
with the same confidentiality and care as other students. They must not share safeguarding
information or confidential details with their partner or family.
• Conflicts of interest: All staff must complete the Register of Business Interests, Conflicts of
Interest, and Declaration of Compliance Form. This is particularly important where a staff
member has children enrolled in the school or close relationships with their child’s peers.
By upholding these standards, staff protect the impartiality of the school, avoid conflicts of interest,
and model integrity.
7.6.9 Expectations for Staff teaching children whose parents work in the school
Teaching a child whose parent is also a member of staff requires particular sensitivity. The aim is to
ensure the child has the same experience as every other student.
Staff must:
• Maintain clear boundaries: Treat the child as any other student. Avoid favouritism or undue
scrutiny linked to the parent’s role. Communicate with the parent as you would with any other
parent, not as a colleague.
• Use formal channels: Share updates on progress via normal school systems (e.g. email,
meetings) and not through casual conversations during the school day. Significant interactions
should be recorded to ensure transparency.
• Protect confidentiality: Do not share confidential information about other students or staff
with the parent, even informally. Keep communication about the student within approved
channels.
• Support the student’s identity: Treat the student as an individual in their own right, providing
equal opportunities and ensuring they are not defined by their parent’s role at the school.
29
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook - Section 7 – September 2025
This approach ensures fairness, consistency, and a positive environment for the child, while protecting
professional relationships and safeguarding standards.
By maintaining professionalism, open communication, and clear boundaries, you’ll help ensure a
healthy, supportive learning environment for the student in which they can flourish.
7.7 Effective Line Management
7.7.1 Guiding Principles
Line managers play a central role in realising the school’s mission of enabling all students to flourish.
They are the vital link between the strategic vision of senior leaders and the daily experiences of staff
and students.
Line managers are responsible not only for managing the performance of their teams, but also for
supporting wellbeing, modelling our values, and creating a culture of openness and trust. In this new
culture at Holy Trinity, line managers will be held accountable for the success, wellbeing, and
development of their teams.
‘Line Manager’ is not a job title but a responsibility. A line manager must:
• Provide clear expectations and supportive guidance.
• Build professional, respectful relationships with colleagues.
• Uphold fairness and consistency, in line with employment law, teachers’ contracts (STPCD),
and NJC support staff contracts.
• Act as a point of communication between staff and senior leaders, ensuring transparency
and clarity.
• Maintain accurate records of discussions, actions, and decisions.
An effective line manager is approachable, organised, and clear in communication. While positive
relationships are encouraged, professional boundaries must be maintained to ensure fairness and
accountability.
7.7.2 Induction of new colleagues
A well-structured induction is essential to helping staff feel welcomed, equipped, and confident in
their role. Line managers are responsible for ensuring all new staff receive a clear, supportive
introduction to the school and their team.
Best practice for induction includes:
• Welcome and ethos: Provide a warm welcome and explain the Christian ethos of the school,
the school’s mission, and how the individual role contributes to student flourishing.
• Policies and procedures: Ensure the staff member reads and understands key policies
(safeguarding, behaviour, health and safety, code of conduct, GDPR, equality and diversity).
• Role clarity: Go through the job description, reporting lines, and expectations for
performance and conduct.
• Practical orientation: Introduce key systems (IT, MIS, email, absence reporting, timetabling)
and provide a tour of facilities.
• Support network: Introduce colleagues, allocate a mentor/buddy, and ensure the new staff
member knows who to go to for help.
• Check-ins: Schedule regular meetings in the first term (e.g. weekly for the first month, then
fortnightly) to review progress, answer questions, and provide feedback.
• Documentation: Keep written notes of induction meetings and confirm actions in writing.
30
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook - Section 7 – September 2025
Line managers are accountable for ensuring induction is thorough and completed within the first
term.
7.7.3 Managing probation
Probation is a formal period of review to confirm suitability for the role. Line managers must take an
active role in ensuring staff are given clarity, support, and fair assessment during this time.
Best practice for probation includes:
• Clear objectives: Agree on written objectives at the start of the probation period, linked to
role requirements and school priorities.
• Regular reviews: Hold structured review meetings (at least at the end of months 1, 3, and 5)
to discuss progress, identify concerns, and provide support.
• Feedback and support: Give honest, constructive feedback, highlighting strengths and areas
for development. Offer support, training, or shadowing as needed.
• Documentation: Keep written records of meetings and outcomes. Confirm in writing
whether progress is satisfactory or whether concerns remain.
• Address issues early: Do not wait until the end of the probation period to raise concerns.
Early intervention is vital.
• Final review: At the end of probation, make a formal recommendation to confirm
appointment, extend probation (if policy allows), or terminate employment.
Probation should never be treated as a “tick box” process. It is a vital tool for embedding new staff,
supporting success, and addressing unsuitability quickly and fairly.
7.7.4 Supporting Wellbeing
Line managers play a crucial role in supporting staff wellbeing and creating an environment where
people can thrive.
Best practice for wellbeing includes:
• Open communication: Be approachable and available for regular, informal check-ins.
• Workload monitoring: Watch for signs of excessive workload and support staff in prioritising
or escalating issues where appropriate.
• Encouragement: Recognise achievements and encourage staff to share successes.
• Professional boundaries: Support staff in balancing work and personal responsibilities,
modelling healthy boundaries.
• Early intervention: Act promptly if a colleague shows signs of stress, disengagement, or ill
health.
• Signposting: Ensure staff are aware of available support (e.g. HR, occupational health,
Employee Assistance Programme, pastoral support).
Wellbeing is not a “nice to have” — it directly impacts performance, student outcomes, and the
culture of the school.
7.7.5 Attendance management
Line managers are directly responsible for managing attendance in line with policy, ensuring fairness
and consistency, and reducing the impact of absence on student learning.
31
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook - Section 7 – September 2025
Responsibilities include:
• Recording absence: Authorise or decline absence requests promptly through the online
system.
• Timekeeping: Monitor punctuality and address issues early.
• Return to work meetings: Hold a structured return-to-work discussion after every period of
sickness absence. This should cover: reason for absence, any ongoing concerns, support
needed, and a reminder of attendance expectations.
• Monitoring patterns: Watch for frequent short absences, patterns (e.g. regular
Mondays/Fridays), or repeated long-term absence, and raise concerns with HR where
appropriate.
• Supporting staff: Where absence is linked to medical or personal issues, offer reasonable
support and adjustments in line with employment law.
• Escalation: Where attendance does not improve, follow the formal stages of the school’s
absence management policy, involving HR as necessary.
Best practice for attendance includes:
• Keep written notes of all conversations about absence.
• Balance compassion with accountability: support the person but do not ignore persistent
poor attendance.
• Remind staff that attendance is a contractual obligation and directly impacts students.
• Seek HR guidance early rather than letting issues drift.
7.7.5.1 Absence request forms
Full details regarding staff absence are set out in Section 7.3 of the Staff Handbook, including links to
relevant policies. This section provides additional expectations and guidance to address the high
levels of absence historically experienced.
At Holy Trinity, absence is an exception, not an entitlement. Every day out of school has a direct
impact on students’ learning, colleagues’ workload, and the school’s financial position due to the
cost of cover. Staff are expected to take full responsibility for minimising absence, and line managers
are accountable for ensuring all requests are properly scrutinised and only approved when absolutely
necessary.
All planned absence – including requests to “keep free” a time slot (for example, for a meeting) or
absences for school business such as a trip – must be made via the online absence request form.
When you receive a request from someone you line manage, you must review it thoroughly, applying
the following principles:
Key considerations for line managers:
• Check calendar restrictions: Confirm it is not a “No More Out” day on the school Outlook
calendar.
• Review school calendar: Cross-check for clashes with exams, key events, or staff shortages.
• Assess the impact: Consider what will not happen as a result of the absence – particularly
lessons or essential services – and how this affects students, colleagues, and the wider
organisation.
• Plan mitigation: Ensure the impact can be minimised and that, where applicable, time is
made up.
• Training requests: Approve only if the training clearly aligns with whole-school priorities, is
directly relevant to the role, and the cost is within budget.
• Personal appointments: These should be arranged outside core working hours wherever
possible. Approval during the school day should only be granted in exceptional
circumstances, and only where no alternative is possible.32
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook - Section 7 – September 2025
• Exceptional leave (e.g. wedding, funeral): These must be referred to the Head of School.
Such absences are normally unpaid and granted at the discretion of the Head of School.
Expectations for staff making requests:
• Absence should always be a last resort. Staff should consider whether an alternative time or
arrangement is possible.
• Staff must provide sufficient detail in the request form to enable their line manager to make
an informed decision.
• Staff should not assume approval. Requests will only be agreed once the line manager is
satisfied the absence is necessary and the impact has been properly managed.
Decision-making:
• If you are not fully satisfied with the information provided, you must arrange to discuss the
request with the member of staff.
• Only approve the absence when you are confident that all considerations have been
addressed and that the request is justified.
• Remember: it is not the role of HR or senior leadership to automatically approve requests —
the line manager is accountable for the first level of decision-making.
Reference to policies:
Several policies set out the framework for different types of absence (e.g. the Staff Discretionary
Leave Policy). Line managers must consult the relevant policy before making a decision and seek
advice from HR where necessary. All such policies are available in the All Staff Team: Policies
7.7.5.2 Managing sickness absence
Holy Trinity has historically experienced exceptionally high levels of absence. This has a direct impact
on students, colleagues, and the school’s budget through the cost of cover. Moving forward, absence
must be managed robustly, consistently, and fairly, with a clear expectation that attendance is the
norm and absence is an exception.
Reporting sickness absence
• All staff sickness absence is reported to WSCC Payroll.
• Following each period of sickness absence, employees are required to complete an online
Return to Work form. Completion of this form is the employee’s responsibility, and
automated reminders will be sent.
• Line managers must also track absence closely and ensure that Return to Work forms are
submitted and reviewed for every period of absence. Failure by an employee to complete a
form is a breach of procedure and must be followed up.
Return to Work discussions
• Once the form is submitted, a copy will be sent to the line manager. You must review this
carefully and determine whether a further in-person meeting is required with your staff
member.
• Return to Work meetings are not optional, especially where there are concerns or where a
trigger has been reached. These meetings provide an opportunity to reinforce expectations,
identify support needs, and hold staff accountable for their attendance.
• Following any such meeting, the line manager must send a brief written record of the
discussion and agreed actions to the employee and HR, to be placed on the personnel file.
When to hold an in-person meeting
A meeting must be arranged if any of the following are indicated on the form:
33
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook - Section 7 – September 2025
• An underlying health condition, treatment, or medication that may impact the employee’s
ability to carry out their role safely or effectively.
• The absence is attributed to a workplace accident or injury (this must also be recorded on
the online accident/incident reporting system).
• The employee attributes their ill health to a disability or to work-related stress.
• The information suggests the school may be able to provide reasonable support or
adjustments to help sustain attendance.
Absence triggers
Line managers must also review the overall attendance record and assess whether a trigger point has
been reached under the Staff Sickness Policy. Triggers must not be ignored. Where a trigger is
reached, HR must be contacted immediately to confirm and to initiate the next steps.
The current triggers are:
• Trigger 1: 4 absences in 4 months
• Trigger 2: 8 or more working days in the last 12 months
• Trigger 3: Long-term absence of more than 21 consecutive days
If a trigger is met, a formal process will be initiated. HR will lead the meeting, but the line manager
must be present and actively engaged.
Long-term absence
Where an employee is absent long-term, HR will guide the line manager on appropriate keeping-in-
touch arrangements. Line managers are expected to maintain supportive but professional contact,
ensuring the member of staff remains connected to the school community while recovery and
return-to-work plans are considered.
See the STAFF Sickness Absence Policy on the All-Staff Team Policies for further details.
7.7.5.3 Responding to issues of timekeeping
As role models for our students, staff are expected to demonstrate the same high standards of
punctuality that we require from them. Punctuality is not optional – it is a professional expectation.
Persistent lateness undermines student learning, places unfair pressure on colleagues, and damages
the culture of professionalism we are building.
Expectations for staff:
• The school day begins at 08:45 and ends at 15:10.
• Full-time teaching staff must be on site by 08:35 and remain until 15:25, unless otherwise
directed.
• Support staff working times are set by their contract. Line managers must ensure that staff
are clear about their contracted hours.
• Staff must also be punctual for all lessons, meetings, duties, and other responsibilities.
Line manager responsibilities:
Line managers must actively monitor punctuality and address concerns promptly. Where lateness is
identified (whether directly observed or reported by others), the following process must be followed:
1. Initial meeting: Arrange a timely meeting with the staff member to discuss concerns, remind
them of contractual expectations, and explore any underlying reasons. Make it clear that
punctuality is a core professional duty.
2. Written confirmation: Follow up with an email confirming the conversation, the
expectations reiterated, and the agreed actions. State explicitly when you will review
progress (e.g. “in four weeks’ time I will review your punctuality record”).
3. Review meeting: Hold the review meeting at the agreed time.34
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook - Section 7 – September 2025
4. o If punctuality has improved, thank the colleague and confirm this in writing.
o If punctuality has not improved, escalate the concern in line with the school’s
disciplinary procedures.
Record-keeping: Retain copies of all emails and notes of meetings. These may be required
for formal procedures if the issue persists.
Additional guidance:
• HR can provide absence and punctuality data if needed. Contact HR to request information if
you wish to check patterns of timekeeping.
• If you are unsure about handling a punctuality matter, seek guidance from HR before the
situation escalates.
Important: Failure to meet punctuality expectations is a conduct matter. Repeated or serious
lateness will be dealt with under the school’s disciplinary procedures.
7.7.6 Managing performance and conduct
An essential part of your role as a line manager is holding staff to account for their performance and
conduct. This responsibility is central to creating the professional culture we expect at Holy Trinity
Church of England Secondary School, where high standards are non-negotiable and where all staff
contribute positively to student learning and the wider school community.
Key reference policy:
The Staff Standards of Conduct Policy (STAFF Standards of Conduct.pdf.) sets out the expectations
for all employees.
Line managers must familiarise themselves with this policy and ensure that staff in their team are
also aware of it.
• Conduct concerns should always be addressed promptly and in line with policy. Ignoring poor
conduct or performance damages team morale and undermines the school’s culture.
Line manager responsibilities:
If you are made aware of, or personally observe, behaviour or performance that falls below
expectations, you must act without delay.
Steps for addressing issues:
1. Initial fact-finding
o Establish what has happened, when, and whether there is evidence or corroboration.
o Avoid making assumptions. Gather information objectively.
2. Informal meeting
o Meet with the staff member promptly to raise the issue.
o Be clear, specific, and factual about the concern (e.g. “On three occasions in the last
two weeks you have…”).
o Give the staff member the opportunity to respond. Listen carefully.
o Reinforce the standards expected, referencing the Staff Standards of Conduct policy.
3. Confirm in writing
o Send a brief email confirming the conversation, the standards clarified, and any
actions required.
o State when you will review progress and the consequences if improvement does not
occur.
35
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook - Section 7 – September 2025
4. Follow-up review
o Meet again at the agreed time to review progress.
o If improvement has been made, acknowledge this and thank the colleague.
o If there has been no or insufficient improvement, escalate in line with HR and the
school’s disciplinary or capability procedures.
5. Record-keeping
o Keep clear written records of all meetings and emails.
o Records may be required if the matter escalates to a formal stage.
Important notes:
• Always act consistently and fairly. Treat like cases alike.
• Do not delay or avoid raising issues – this only allows poor practice to become embedded.
• Seek HR advice if you are unsure whether an issue should be managed informally or formally.
• If an allegation is of a safeguarding nature, it must be reported immediately in line with
safeguarding procedures, not handled informally.
The key policy in relation to staff conduct is the Staff Standards of Conduct STAFF Standards of
Conduct.pdf.
7.7.7 Reporting safeguarding allegations or low-level concerns
As part of our safeguarding culture at Holy Trinity Church of England Secondary School, all staff are
expected to report any safeguarding allegations or concerns about colleagues – including what may
appear to be “low-level” concerns. This is a requirement under the Keeping Children Safe in
Education (KCSIE) statutory guidance.
What is a low-level concern?
A low-level concern is any behaviour by a member of staff (including volunteers, supply, or
contractors) that:
• is inconsistent with the Staff Code of Conduct, and/or
• does not meet the threshold of harm, but may still give rise to concern about a person’s
suitability to work with children.
Examples may include:
• Being over-familiar with students, including unnecessary physical contact.
• Using inappropriate language or humour.
• Failing to maintain professional boundaries (e.g. informal communication with students).
• Breaches of the Staff Code of Conduct, even if minor.
How to report a concern
• Staff should report all safeguarding allegations and low-level concerns immediately, using the
Confide system, which is available on the desktop of all HTS devices.
• Concerns can also be raised verbally with the Executive Headteacher – but they must still be
logged on Confide.
• Staff must not investigate the matter themselves or attempt to resolve it informally.
Line manager responsibilities
• If a member of your team raises a concern with you, you must thank them for raising it,
ensure it is logged on Confide, and alert the Executive Headteacher.
• You must not dismiss or downplay any concern, no matter how small it may seem.
• Ensure records are factual, accurate, and logged without delay.
36
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook - Section 7 – September 2025
• Seek advice from the Executive Headteacher if you are unsure whether something
constitutes a low-level concern or requires escalation.
Follow-up and culture
• All concerns will be reviewed by the safeguarding team and managed in line with KCSIE and
safer recruitment principles.
• Patterns of low-level concerns may indicate more serious issues; this is why consistent
reporting is essential.
• Staff who raise concerns in good faith are protected under the school’s whistleblowing
policy.
Key principle:
It is always better to record and report a concern that turns out to be minor, than to fail to report
something that later proves to be significant.
7.8 Health and Safety
Health and Safety at Holy Trinity Church of England Secondary School is everyone’s responsibility. It
is not confined to the premises team – in a live school environment, every member of staff has a duty
of care to keep themselves, students, colleagues, and visitors safe.
Core expectation: All staff must do everything reasonably practicable to ensure our working
environment is safe, healthy, and without risk of harm. This includes being proactive, alert, and
taking ownership when hazards or risks are identified.
Staff responsibilities:
All staff are required to:
• Know and follow policies: Familiarise themselves with the School Health & Safety Policy and
related documents including risk assessments, safe systems of work, off-site activity
regulations, fire procedures, and minibus use.
• Be hazard-aware: Understand the hazards specific to their subject area or role. This includes
knowing where emergency exits, first aid equipment, and accident reporting systems are
located.
• Use equipment safely:
o Always wear and use appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) when
required.
o Take reasonable care of all equipment provided.
o Never allow students to plug in electrical appliances.
o Conduct visual checks of electrical and potentially hazardous equipment daily.
• Secure hazardous spaces: Ensure rooms containing electrical or hazardous equipment are
kept locked when not in use.
• Report incidents and defects immediately:
o Report any damage, hazard, or defect using the electronic Facilities form on the staff
portal.
o In the case of an accident or incident involving staff or students, complete an
Incident Form via the WSCC portal: https://wscc.info-exchange.com/SchoolIncident.
• Be vigilant off-site: Apply the same standards of safety and risk awareness during trips, visits,
and extracurricular activities.
Line manager responsibilities:
• Reinforce health and safety expectations with their teams.
• Ensure that risk assessments are in place, up to date, and followed.
• Monitor that staff are compliant with PPE, safe working practices, and reporting procedures.
37
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook - Section 7 – September 2025
• Escalate issues immediately if hazards are not addressed or if staff repeatedly fail to comply
with safety standards.
Culture of responsibility:
• Health and Safety is not optional and cannot be delegated away.
• If you see a risk or hazard, do something about it (including reporting on the FM Helpdesk) –
do not assume someone else will.
• Taking shortcuts with safety is unacceptable and will be treated as a conduct matter under
the Staff Standards of Conduct.
7.9 Fire and evacuation policy
7.9.1 Philosophy
When the fire alarm sounds it is school policy that a complete evacuation takes place. Staff and
students should proceed to the area on and around the front tennis courts and assemble in their
allocated places in silence. The fire brigade is no longer summoned on occasion that the fire alarm is
sounded, unless a fire is reported. This is standard West Sussex Fire and Rescue policy for schools.
Fire-fighting or other action is not to be attempted except to remove immediate danger to students
and staff. All staff share the responsibility for the personal safety of the students and staff. Crucially,
each member of staff must ensure that they:
1. register themselves as present
2. 3. register students present if they are a tutor
maintain silence and good order
7.9.2 Summary of key actions to be taken by all staff if the fire alarm sounds
• The process should take place in silence until students and staff are instructed otherwise
• It is essential all staff register with their assigned fire warden
• It is essential that all students are accounted for. Tutors report to the Group Leader for their
year to collect registration lists
• Tutors register their group and return the list to the Group Leader for their year. Tutors are
responsible for the supervision of their group and should ensure their tutees wait in silence
• Teaching staff without tutor group responsibilities should go to the Year Group to which they
are attached and be registered by the Group Leader, who may then direct them to support
with the Year Group
• Support staff should report to their assigned Fire Warden or Deputy
In addition to this guidance see also Fire and Evacuation policy and the Fire Warden Handbook in
Policies
7.10 Matters relating to the school site
7.10.1 Opening and closing times
The school is opened on each school day at 06.00 and closed at 19.00, unless circumstances which
are beyond the schools control deem it necessary to change these operating hours. Details of the
duty facilities officer are shown on the yellow card visible in the main reception door. On non-school
days (excluding weekends and bank holidays) the school is opened at 08.00 and closed at 17:00.
Reception is manned from 08:00 – 16:00 Monday – Thursday and 08:00 – 15:30 on Friday during
38
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook - Section 7 – September 2025
term time only. Arrangements must be made to meet and host visitors arriving in school outside of
these hours.
Students leaving during the school day must do so via main reception (having first signed out at the
Medical & Attendance office) and will be collected there by the person authorised to collect them. If
a parent/carer brings an item into school for their child (e.g. forgotten lunch, PE kit etc..) reception
will arrange for a message to be delivered to the student asking them to collect the items from
reception. If a student needs to make a phone call home, then they must go to reception. Students
who are NOT physically able to make their way around school (e.g. due to an injury such as a broken
leg/on crutches for example) and are working in the library for the day due to the injury, will be
allowed to enter and leave school via the main entrance. Students waiting for the bus or for parents
to collect them at the end of the school day must wait on the front tennis courts. Any students found
in the reception area without authorisation will be asked to leave the area.
7.10.2 Maintenance issues
Premises maintenance or furniture provision requests should be made using the premises helpdesk.
7.10.3 Room bookings
Bookings during the school day between 08.00 and 17.30 can be made by staff using the Room
Booking Requests section in Bromcom, which can be found in Modules under Diary.
Bookings for rooms after 17.30 should be booked via the Business Manager or Finance Office and will
also require the completion of an On- Site Activity Form as in Section 7.1
7.10.4 Minibus
• Only named drivers may drive the minibuses. In addition to holding an appropriate
classification on their driving licence, drivers must hold a WSCC Minibus Permit which is
obtained by undergoing an assessment. Staff wishing to undergo this assessment may book
through the Finance Office
• The minibus must be booked via the Finance Office
• Each vehicle contains a logbook, which must be completed by the driver for each trip. The
conditions of use including vehicle checks must be complied with
• Use Only Diesel Fuel. To avoid the need for cash payments for fuel, Fuel Cards are available
and should be obtained from the Finance Office
• Keys and fuel cards MUST be returned to the Finance Office on the day of the booking unless
specific alternative arrangements have been agreed with the Finance Office
7.10.5 Car parking
There is parking available on site for staff vehicles. All vehicles are parked on the school site at the
owner’s risk. No liability can be accepted for any damage howsoever caused. There is a system of
internal gates within the site, which are locked during the school day. Vehicles parked inside the
locked gates must remain there until the gates are unlocked at the end of the school day. Staff
intending to leave during the school day must park in the main car park or otherwise outside of the
gates.
39
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook - Section 7 – September 2025
7.10.6 Catering
Basic refreshments are available for staff use for meetings/gatherings and can be found in the locked
cupboard in G100 – the key for this is located in the Finance Office and available on request. Staff
must organise the set up and pack down of any items used and ensure things are put away promptly
after use and are clean. Items available include:
• Tea
• Coffee
• Sugar
• Milk (This is to be requested from the refectory)
• Insulated Milk Jug
• Small Milk Jug
• 2 x Urns (to heat water)
• 3 x Pump Pots (to keep water hot)
• Water Jugs
• Sugar pots
• Teaspoons
Requests for hospitality catering from the refectory for meetings, visitors or other gatherings should
be made using the electronic form in the staff portal of the website and the costs will come out of
department budgets.
7.10.7 Cashless catering
The school operates a cashless system for payments, which is accessed using a Biometric
Identification System. All staff must register for this system at ICT Services. Funds are held on a
personal account for each member of staff. If you wish to purchase food, you will need to credit your
account in advance. This is done via the cash machine in the refectory or online. Credit is not
available. All funds are held in the name of the Contract Caterer (currently Caterlink). Refunds of
credit held on staff personal accounts can be made on application to the contract caterer using a
form available from the Finance Office.
If you are entitled to a lunch because you do a lunch duty this will be added to the system to allow
you to receive a daily allowance of £3.06 (inc VAT). This is only valid for the day of the duty and is not
cumulative or transferrable. If you wish to buy food exceeding this value, please be prepared to pay
the extra. If you swap a duty previously allocated to a colleague, the change of entitlement must be
made by the Finance Office prior to use of the refectory.
7.11 Finance
7.11.1 Collection of money and charging
• The school is totally cashless and therefore any cash and/or cheques can only be
accepted/taken after prior approval of the Finance Team.
• All monies collected on behalf of the school, or Departments within it, must be accounted for
including a detailed contributor list and handed into Finance, never left in drawers etc.
• You cannot levy any charge for services by the school without the prior agreement of the
Executive Headteacher, Business Manager or Finance Manager. You must not make any
changes to previously agreed charges without approval. The Charging Policy within Teams /
All Staff / Policies must be complied with.
40
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook - Section 7 – September 2025
7.11.2 Paying in
• We can invite purchases electronically and receive payment electronically.
• All payments for trips, visits and events are to be handled by the Operations Team via the
school’s parent application Scopay. Providing guidelines are adhered to, other staff should
not need to handle money for these activities.
7.11.3 Ordering of goods and services
• All orders for goods and services are to be placed via the Finance Office using the Online
Order Form. This can be found in the All Staff Team folder under ‘Order Form ‘on the top
line.
• If it is necessary to operate outside this arrangement, dispensation should be obtained from
the School Business Manager and/or the Assistant Business Manager, before the order is
placed.
• It is not permissible to take advantage of the specially reduced prices available to the school
for personal purchases. Staff needing to undertake a personal transaction must see the
Assistant Business Manager so that appropriate permissions can be obtained prior to the
purchase.
• Staff purchasing items for school may not use personal loyalty cards and the school does
have loyalty cards for most shops should they be required.
• These matters are a requirement of Local Government Purchasing Regulations and are
subject to WSCC Audit Procedures
7.11.4 Payment for goods/services and/or reimbursement of expenses (September 2022
• No staff expenses for goods/services are permitted unless agreed prior by the Finance Team.
• If it has been agreed, please obtain an internal Payment Request Form, complete it, attach
receipts, obtain authorisation where appropriate and pass to the Finance Office. Payments are
usually made via bacs payment directly into the staff members bank account and not via salaries.
(Remembering at this stage, we cannot accept receipts using any personal loyalty cards unless it
is the school ones directly). This is an audit requirement of WSCC.
• Requests for payment of travel expenses for courses and other visits can be made by submitting
a payment request form to the finance office accompanied by receipts. All expenses are paid in
accordance with the staff expenses policy. This states that the most economic method of
transport must be used and that travel costs can only be paid from the school as the place of
work, not your home address (this is an HMRC requirement).
41
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook - Section 7 – September 2025
• Requests for mileage payments require completion of a special form and reimbursement is made
via payroll. A VAT fuel receipt is required in all cases – this is an Inland Revenue requirement
Full details are contained in the Financial Management Policy Policies
7.11.5 Payment of invoices
Invoices are normally received directly by the Finance Office via email.
They are reconciled with the original order and then passed to the appropriate budget holder for
authorisation via a sign-off form or to the member of staff confirming receipt of the order if the
budget holder has previously approved the request via the Online Order Form.
The authorised invoice should be returned promptly to the Finance Office for payment.
If you receive an invoice directly, please pass it to the Finance Office without delay. Finance staff will
process and arrange for an authorisation form to be passed to the budget holder for signing off.
7.11.6 Deliveries
Goods are normally delivered to reception. They are then either delivered to departments or
notification will be sent stating that the goods are ready for collection. Please ensure that goods are
collected promptly. If staff need Premises Staff to move large or heavy orders, please complete an
online Maintenance Ticket.
7.11.7 Forms
The Online Order Form can be located on the All Staff teams folder.
All other Claim Forms are all available online or via the Finance Office.
7.11.8 Governors Fund
Every family with children at the school is asked to make a donation to the Governors Fund.
Currently the suggested amount is £60. Letters are sent home each academic year. Details of how to
make payment directly into the Governors fund bank account are specified on the letters. Cash is no
longer accepted the office.
7.12 Reprographics
The school has a reprographics office that can produce printing, copying, binding, laminating and a
design service if required. For cost reasons, all requests for copying in excess of 15 copies must be
routed through this. Each staff member has a PIN code to enable small quantities of printing or
copying to be done, charged to their department. Your PIN code will be supplied by the Finance &
Administration Team. Requests for reprographics should be made through the helpdesk – the link is
available on the All Staff Teams / SharePoint page.

      SECTION 4
PASTORAL CARE & SAFEGUARDING
4.1 Pastoral Care
The role of the Pastoral Team is to ensure students have the capacity to experience success through
the taught curriculum so that they may achieve their potential and flourish in our community. The
role of the Pastoral Team is to help overcome barriers in individual student lives and circumstances
which reduce their capacity to learn and grown.
Please note that the key policy guidance and routine procedures you need to read for this section
are:
• Confidential Reporting Policy (All Staff Teams Folder)
• Safeguarding Children Policy (All Staff Teams Folder)
• Keeping children safe in education 2025: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68add931969253904d155860/Keeping_children_safe_in_education_from_1_September_2025.pdf
• Working together to safeguard children 2023: statutory guidance
4.1.1 Principles & approach
“Pastoral care is not just about managing behaviour. Good pastoral support is concerned with
academic attainment and developing students’ ability to become good citizens." - from Guidance on
the National standards for supporting teaching and learning in schools – DfE (Department for
Education)
Pastoral care is one of the key ways in which we can express in practice our fundamental belief that
each one is created in the image of God and as such is precious and special. Therefore, pastoral care
is central to our school and our provision for our children, ensuring that each child receives the help
they need to flourish as a learner and to progress throughout their time at the school and into adult
life. Pastoral care encompasses the areas of well-being, behaviour, progress, and pathways and is at
the heart of our Christian ethos. Good pastoral care enables students to make sense of their school
life and to make a success of their education.
4.1.2 Pastoral structure
The school has eight tutor groups in Years 7 to 11 and five tutor groups in the Sixth Form. The school
PAN was increased from 210 to 240 from September 2022 meaning currently Years 7 to 9 are 240,
and Years 10 and 11 are 240. Students are placed into year-based tutor groups. The tutor has
oversight of the fundamental academic, behavioural, and social needs of their tutor group and will
guide them through the processes in their year of study. They are the first port of call in the pastoral
care system for their tutees.
Year 7 Year Leader – Mrs Sally Eves-Dann
Year 8 Year Leader – Miss Sally Benhamed
Year 9 Year Leader – Mr Jacob Reeve
Year 10 Year Leader – Mr Phil Hunt
Year 11 Year Leader – Mr Craig Simpson-Smith
A full breakdown of the tutor teams can be found in section 2, Appendix 2.1.
The Deputy Headteacher has responsibility for the strategic leadership of all aspects of Pastoral care.
Six of the Assistant Headteachers have a key role within the Pastoral Team. These members of staff
are as below:
3
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook – Section 4 – September 2025
DHT Pastoral – Mr Andrew Cook
AHT SEND – Mr Richard Mullineux
AHT Lead for Years 7&8 – Ms Angela Stylianou
AHT Safeguarding & DSL – Mr Andy Webster
AHT Behaviour and Culture and AHT for Years 9&10 – Mr Alex Sheppard
AHT Lead for Year 11 – Miss Grace Savage
AHT Key Stage 5 – Mr Kevin Berry
4.1.3 Pastoral and Behaviour Support Manager (PBSM)
These are non-teaching staff whose role is to support the year group in every way. The current team
are:
Year 7 Mr Antony Willans
Year 8 Mrs Rachel Rhodes
Year 9 Mrs Anita Lockton
Year 10 Miss Josephine Camara
Year 11 Mr Leon Watson
Sixth Form Mrs Meg Johnson
The Pastoral and Behaviour Support Managers are focused on developing positive relationships with
students in their year group, parents, and staff. The purpose of their role is to enable students to
access their learning. They are directed by their Year Leader who agree their foci.
The PBSMs have a range of key actions which include but are not limited to:
• supporting and challenging students and families attendance and punctuality
• responding to behaviour incidents both positive and negative
• supporting key events for the year group e.g. Options in Year 9
• working closely with the Safeguarding and Pastoral team to support the welfare of students
They will also be present in the allocated year group room at 3:10-3:25pm to support a calm
environment with their Year Leader during restorative conversations.
In the Sixth Form there is also a Sixth Form Administrator
Sixth Form Administrator Mrs Nikki Crossley
4.1.4 Wider Pastoral Structure
There is also a Welfare Manager (Mrs Salie Clarke) who will operate with students from all years.
These students will be allocated on a case load only basis. Such referrals will take place when
circumstances necessitate specialist individualised input. All students on an Early Help Plan or
Welfare Support Plan are overseen by the Welfare Manager.
We have two Safeguarding Managers, Mrs Sheila Whelan (Monday to Wednesday) and Mrs Alison
White (Wednesday to Friday) who oversee students with a Child Protection Plan, Child Looked After,
and students who are a Child in Need or who have some involvement with Social Services.
Working with the Safeguarding Mangers and DSL are two Safeguarding Officers, Miss Chilel Njai and
Mrs Emma Green. They support the Safeguarding team in completing referrals, contacting external
agencies, and monitoring and tracking incidents and data on CPOMS for discussion and follow up.
They also complete all suspension paperwork working with the Assistant Head Teacher Behaviour
and Culture.
4
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School Staff Handbook – Section 4 – September 2025
The Family Liaison Officer (Mr Jon Millwood) is a key member of the wider pastoral and safeguarding
team. The FLO specifically works alongside students, families and professionals to improve
attendance and engagement with relevant curriculum offer.
4.1.5 Assessment of Need (AON)
To triage students showing emotional distress staff can complete an assessment of need form to
highlight a student who may be demonstrating concerns in specific areas. Students will be discussed
weekly and will be assigned to wider support or intervention where it is considered right to do
so. This enables time limited internal interventions to take place, for example, zones of regulation or
referral to Thought-Full or external counselling agencies for more intensive therapy, for example to
CAMHS. All these services are accessed via the Year Leaders.
We also have a Kick London Mentor, Alex White (Monday & Tuesday), who works with students
assigned to him through the assessment of need referral. Alex meets with students for a defined
period, usually 6 weeks unless longer is agreed to set targets and support students who are having a
variety of challenges.
4.1.6 Children We Care For (CWCF)
Many Children Looked After have suffered disrupted learning and may have missed extended periods
of school. Gaps in their learning plus the emotional impact of their experience require excellent
planning and support from all professionals caring for them. Staff must respond promptly to all
requests for information from those who oversee the Children We Care For including progress and
well-being. The Designated Teacher for Children We Care For is the Assistant Headteacher,
Safeguarding and DSL (Mr Andy Webster). The termly Personal Education Plan and the Children
Looked After review is conducted and overseen by the Assistant Headteacher Safeguarding & DSL
(Mr Andy Webster) or the Safeguarding Manager in his absence.
4.2 The role of the tutor
Tutor time sets the tone for the day, and the focus should be on preparing to learn, rather than
socialising and chatting. The expectation is that tutor time is as purposeful as a good lesson and
should be planned for accordingly (see below).
It is primarily intended to prepare students for and to help them make sense of their learning. There
may be times when discussion is appropriate, this time will most often be during the ‘task’.
Discussion should be guided and appropriately focused, with clear objectives. Students should not be
doing homework. If the tutor is working with an individual or section of the tutor group, it is the
responsibility of the tutor to ensure that other students should be purposefully engaging in their own
learning. Suggested examples:
• Reviewing work done previously in preparation for the next lesson
• Revising for examinations
• Reading
Outside of tutor time, tutors should be engaging actively in increasing home / school relations by
ensuring ongoing dialogue is maintained between tutor and parent to help the child engage fully in
their educational opportunities. The tutor has a particularly key role in supporting and challenging
absence in the 5-15% absence banding and encouraging each student to engage in house and extra-
curricular activities.

      SECTION 6 
CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL LEARNING
6.1 Continuing Professional Learning
6.1.1 Philosophy 
Effective Continuing Professional Learning (CPL) focuses on improving teaching and evaluating its 
impact on learning. Through our CPL programme we undertake to:
• Recognise, value, and develop the professional potential, skill, and knowledge of staff
• Invest in learning and development for both individuals and teams
• Promote the principles of high challenge – high support
Our CPL programme aims to:
• Build a learning community where high-quality professional learning and training contributes 
to excellent learning and outcomes for students, and to excellent performance, professional 
development, and job satisfaction for all staff
• Enable staff to tackle areas of challenge or underperformance
• Draw on staff talents and enthusiasm
• Drive forward whole school improvement
‘If improving teaching quality opens the door to raising student achievement, CPL holds the promise 
of acting as a key’ (Joe Kirby). 
6.1.2 Expectations
All staff are expected to take an active responsibility for their own professional development in line 
with their job description and, for teaching staff, the National Teachers’ Standards. It is expected that 
all staff are able to demonstrate the impact of professional development and training undertaken on 
their own practice.
As part of this active responsibility, all staff (who are not ECTs) are required to use the CPL module on 
BlueSky to record and track their CPL activities throughout the year. It is vital that every CPL activity 
is rigorously evaluated for the impact achieved on student learning. The BlueSky programme will 
prompt staff to do this at each of the required intervals.
6.1.3 CPL – teaching staff
A continual development priority is to improve the quality and consistency of teaching and learning 
across all departments in the school in order to improve the outcomes for every student. The key 
tool employed to make this happen is Holy’s Impactful Teaching System (HITS).
All new members of the teaching staff and classroom-based support staff will be trained to TEEP in 
the HITS approach to teaching and learning 1 at the earliest opportunity. 
It is vital that all teaching staff have opportunity to develop teaching strategies that create the most 
value for students. In order to facilitate this, every member of the teaching staff will attend a 
minimum of five sessions in the academic year. These sessions will be a mixture of specific training 
good practice with the key focus being on teaching and learning. 
Further sessions incorporating wider training needs will be offered throughout the year and 
attendance will be directly linked to the provision of one of the two devolved inset days – scheduled 
4
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School - Staff Handbook – Section 6 - September 2025
on 27
th and 28
th November 2025. Every member of teaching staff who works on these two days will 
be required to earn credits linked to their attendance in order to qualify for the devolved inset days. 
Teaching staff working full time will be required to earn five credits (for the devolved Inset day linked 
to training). Staff are only required to pay back time by earning a credit if they have ACTUALLY 
worked on those days. For example, if a member of staff works part time and they were only 
scheduled to work on one of the devolved days then they will only need to earn five credits. It is an 
exact hour for hour repayment and does NOT follow the pro-rata scheme linked to other aspects of 
part time work. These credits can only be earned by training – there can be no substitutes. 
For the academic year 2025-2026, all CPL will be linked to the appraisal targets for every member of 
teaching staff. The training offer for one devolved day will be through teacher research groups which 
focus on deliberate practice and pedagogy using Walkthrus linked to the WSIP. These will be held 
over the year – see calendar- sessions will be on Monday or Wednesday. The second devolved day 
CPL will be the Thursday after school sessions (5) which will focus on training deemed appropriate by
the assistant headteacher for learning and teaching and SLT.
Learning and teaching related to a chosen class will form a target to be registered on the school 
appraisal system (online) at the beginning of the year and will then be evaluated at the end of the 
year. If there is training that you would like to complete this year and it does not feature on the 
whole school menu, submit your request to RSU for approval.
6.1.4 CPL – support staff – classroom based
Classroom based support staff are vital to the delivery of teaching and learning in order to improve 
the outcomes of every student. All classroom-based support staff will be trained in HITS at the 
earliest opportunity.
Further training will be directed towards ensuring that every member of staff can meet the 
requirements of their job description. Together with this, and where appropriate, training will be 
offered which will support further professional development as specified in their P R & D targets.
Sessions incorporating wider training needs will be offered throughout the year and attendance will 
be directly linked to the provision of two devolved inset days. Every member of staff will be required 
to earn credits linked to their attendance in order to qualify for the devolved days. These credits, 
whilst being available through CPL, may also be acquired through other activities. See guidance in 
section 6.1.4. It needs to be noted that for support staff hour for hour repayment will link directly to 
their contracted hours for each day.
6.1.5 CPL – support staff – non-classroom based
Support staff that are not classroom based will be offered training which will be directed towards 
ensuring that they can meet the requirements of their job description. They will also be provided 
with other opportunities through which they can ‘pay back’ the hours taken on the two devolved 
days.
6.1.6 Criteria for approving the application of external courses
Attendance at external courses for teaching staff is allocated according to these criteria, ranked in 
order of priority:
• Training required to meet our statutory obligations
• Training required to enable a colleague to carry out a new role or teach a new course
• Courses which relate directly to new public exam specifications
5
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School - Staff Handbook – Section 6 - September 2025
• Courses which are demonstrably essential to meet an appraisal target or fulfilment of role, 
where in-house training is not applicable, and where training is best provided by an external 
provider
• External subject leader conferences / meeting e.g exam board conferences / training
6.1.7 Applying for an external course
Guidance for applying for external courses will be introduced in September 2025 as we are 
no longer using BlueSky. Training on the new system will be delivered to all staff and then 
the handbook will be updated. In the meantime, please discuss any courses with you line 
manager and / or AHT Learning and Teaching
6.2 Professional Review & Development Goals
6.2.1 Appraisal at Holy Trinity 
• There will be time dedicated to professional review and development during the first half 
term of the academic year.
• Full guidance is contained in the booklet for appraisal in the ALL-STAFF TEAM under 
‘Appraisal’.
• The Governors Pay Committee will meet on 8th October 2024.
• All teaching staff have a school improvement target.
• All teaching staff have a student progress target.
• All teaching staff have a CPL target linked to their teacher research group work/ CPL training.
All of these targets are recorded on the school appraisal system.
• These targets are evidenced throughout the year (time is given to the meeting structure to 
enable this to happen).
• For more detailed information about teacher appraisal please speak to Mrs Radha Stuart.
• All support staff have two whole school targets.
• All support staff have a CPL target linked to the development of their role / skills to support 
their role.
All of these targets are recorded on the school appriasal system.
6.2.2 Student progress target (teachers only)
• The first target is based on progress and outcome. This target is based upon the individual 
student progress and outcomes (of those taken professional examinations) being positive 
value added.
• ALPS and SISRA will be used to make this judgement initially with the IDSR being used to 
confirm judgements when it is released. This means that all assessments will be made 
against unvalidated data and this needs to be reflected in all discussions.
• There is some room for flexibility with this target in regard to the nature of students within 
the group. A professional dialogue needs to happen between the reviewer and reviewee in 
regard to this.
6.2.3 Teaching & learning target and Personal Development Plan (PDP) (teachers only) for 
review September 2025
Targets for 2024-25 will be reviewed using Bluesky in the first half term of 2025. We will then 
move to a new system which will be introduced in all staff training in September 2025. The 
handbook will then be updated.
6
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School - Staff Handbook – Section 6 - September 2025
6.2.4 Whole school targets (ALL STAFF)
• This target helps teachers and support staff to focus on the Whole School Improvement Plan
and how to contribute towards school improvement within their role.
• For teachers, it can specifically mention wider school responsibilities which could include, but 
are not limited to, meeting all deadlines for registers, data, and other internal processes.
• Wider professional responsibilities for a leader centre around fulfilling your leadership roles, 
including the delivery of your Area Improvement Plan.
• Responsibilities for support staff centre around fulfilling your role in systems and practices 
that support the WSIP.
6.2.5 Career stage descriptors (teachers only)
• Please see the tables at the end of this section.
6.2.6 UPS descriptors
• UPS1 – Significant impact in your own classroom and with other colleagues: collaboration 
and sharing of good practice.
• UPS2 – Significant impact beyond the classroom, including impact on others’ practice and 
significant contribution to the department and/or whole school improvement/development 
(could be action research project/development group/development project/training for 
other staff).
• UPS3 – Significant impact within or beyond your department, including impact on others 
practice, and leading on or making significant contributions to school innovation projects 
and/or policy development, training or outreach (To lead or at least contribute significantly 
on one of the following: a development focus group/a development project/ an action 
research project/whole school policy development/leadership or school improvement 
outreach to other schools).
6.2.7 UPS progression
• You must meet the expert criteria on the career stage descriptors to move into the UPS.
• There are a range of defined expectations that need to be evidenced against descriptors for 
the two years prior to application.
• A formal application must be made as a part of the process.
• A yearly UPS log has to be maintained on BlueSky to evidence that you continue to meet the 
criteria.
6.3 Underperformance, additional professional development & training
The CPL process and appraisal process are the main frameworks for addressing professional 
performance. These processes need to be robust and well informed.
For all staff, any on-going professional issues need to be addressed initially through the CPL 
process/appraisal by the line manager of the member of staff concerned. The SLT link should be kept 
informed of any performance concerns, and should monitor and support the initial target setting, 
support & monitoring procedures. 
If there are issues concerning the professional performance of ECTs then this needs to be addressed 
by the Director of Learning and Teaching working in conjunction with The Induction Manager, the 
Induction Mentor and Leader of Learning. Any support process for an ECT needs to follow the 
national guidelines for ECTs in conjunction with the Appropriate Body Xavier, and not the BlueSky 
school process.
7
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School - Staff Handbook – Section 6 - September 2025
6.3.1 Aims of this guidance
• To help line manager and performance management reviewers identify & address 
professional problems/issues, experience by a member or members of their teams, which 
may impact on student learning, progress, and/or wellbeing 
• To ensure appropriate support is given for staff in a timely fashion
• To provide a shared framework for address early concerns about performance or capability.
6.3.2 Principles
• The learning, welfare and progress of the students is paramount
• If we have evidence that a member of staff is not meeting required professional standards,
we have a professional duty to both students and staff to intervene to address performance 
issues
• Staff have an entitlement to training and support, and a responsibility to engage with 
feedback & professional development
Judgements regarding performance should be well informed & evidenced; informed by performance 
against the professional standards, student progress data and lesson observation and learning walk 
data.
6.3.3 Identifying concerns
Sometimes it is immediately obvious there is a problem. More often, for teaching staff, there are low 
level issues that have a cumulative impact on student learning and performance. Regular monitoring 
of student progress together with lesson observation and learning walks should flag up any regular 
incidences of poor behaviour, inconsistent or low levels of engagement and poor or sub-standard 
student progress. Concerns may also be raised by parents and students. Any reports of concerns 
must be properly evaluated and reviewed. There must be varied evidence of a pattern of problems as 
outlined above before a meeting is held. Any concerns and interventions should be placed on the 
school appraisal system.
For support staff, at first there may be low level underperformance of tasks that need attention and 
improvement. Regular checking in and discussion of task completion with a line manager can flag up
and issues and support improvement interventions where required. Where further CPL / training is 
required, this can be addressed and placed on the school appraisal system.
6.3.4 Supportive Intervention (Additional teacher development) level 1 - SINT 1
• SINT 1a short term additional development focus
• SINT 1b addresses a specific learning / development point and /or initial concerns which can 
be addressed with a limited time extension
SINT 1a
This will usually involve short term targets for improvement against a specific aspect of the teaching 
standards. Following discussion with the Assistant Headteacher - Learning and Teaching, Director of 
Learning and Teaching or the colleague’s team leader or leader of learning should meet with the 
colleague to draw up an action plan to address the issue. This may involve additional mentoring or 
coaching from the Leader of Learning, team leader/appraisal reviewer or an appropriate subject 
colleague, or, where appropriate a colleague from outside the department.
Progress should be recorded on Blue Sky as CPL activity SINT 1a by the colleague being supported. 
Targets should be time limited, with evidence of progress in half term or 6 weeks.
SINT 1a support should not last longer than this unless there are mitigating circumstances such as 
illness. However, if a colleague needs to just fine tune a single aspect, then time can be given for this 
without progression to SINT 2. This extended time will be known as SINT 1b. If sufficient progress is 
8
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School - Staff Handbook – Section 6 - September 2025
not made or further development is needed the colleague should move on to Supportive 
Intervention (Additional Teacher Development) level 2 – SINT 2. 
6.3.5 Supportive Intervention (Additional professional development) level 2 - SINT 2
If department typicality evaluation such as drop ins/work scrutinise /planning checks reveal 
consistent patterns or evidence of concerns about underperformance against more than one of the 
teacher standards over a period of time, and / or there is an aspect of practice that has not 
responded to initial SINT 1a (and 1b where necessary) advice & intervention, the SINT 2 programme 
should apply.
6.3.6 The SINT 2 schedule
• If the Leader of Learning is not the team leader (line manager). The team leader must let the 
Leader of Learning, SLT link, Assistant Headteacher - Learning and Teaching and Director of 
Learning and Teaching know immediately. The colleague must be assigned a mentor from 
within the department or other agreed mentor, who will meet with the colleague weekly for 
coaching / mentoring sessions addressing the specific targets for improvement. The mentor 
can be the Leader of Learning or Reviewer but does not have to be.
• Actions on the SINT 2 plan should include the colleague submitting regular HITS lesson plans 
at each weekly meeting; talking through these plans with their mentor; attendance at 
appropriate training sessions; observing at least two good practitioners/ lessons within the 6-
week time frame; & having two peer observations, together with feedback for each prior to 
the next formal observation
• Other training /support may include keeping a learning/reflection log; guidance on suitable 
resources/approaches, Time management advice/ well-being coaching / team teaching with 
mentor/coach/ HITS Top Up training with Lead Practitioners as appropriate
• Progress should be monitored by weekly meetings, with a record kept on the SINT 2 Action 
Plan; evidence of planning, 2 unannounced drop -ins and at least one follows up formal 
observation towards the end of the programme
Meetings; planning, observation of good practice & general notes should be recorded on BlueSky by 
the colleague & monitored by the mentor via the note's facility on BlueSky. Lesson observations and 
Drop ins on the improving colleague should be recorded by the observer/s. Copies of the SINT 2
Action Plan must be made to the member of staff concerned, the Leader of Learning, Link SLT & 
Radha Stuart (Assistant Headteacher - Learning and Teaching).
6.3.7 Time frames
• The time frame for initial improvement will be no longer than half a term or eight weeks. 
There must be an interim review meeting agreed after 3/4 weeks, and a formal review after 
6 weeks. The review should be recorded using the Overview Statements, with the title SINT 2
Review. A copy of this must be sent to the link SLT and Radha Stuart. If targets are met, the 
member of staff has been successful and will come off the SINT programme at that point
• If improvement is shown, but is not yet fully secure or sustained, the interventions should be 
extended for another half term maximum (No longer than 6 weeks) The Review process 
above should be repeated
• In certain cases, it may be judged appropriate that the programme is extended in to a second 
term. SLT link advice should always be sought here before a decision is made, with the 
decision informed by the colleague’s willingness to engage with the programme, evidence of 
progress to date and a clear plan for next steps
A colleague should not remain on SINT for more than two terms. The emphasis is on support for 
improvement and success. 
9
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School - Staff Handbook – Section 6 - September 2025
SLT line managers should be kept fully up to date with progress for ATD staff and will act as advisors 
and coaches for Line Managers.
In the event of a member of staff not making sufficient progress within the first or second review 
period, over two terms, Capability Procedures will apply.
In the event of a need for this intervention the Director of Learning and Teaching, Leader of Learning 
and SLT link must be informed.
6.3.8 Summary
• Line manager to create a CPL activity for the teacher on school appraisal system.
• Title of CPL activity will be ‘Supportive Intervention – SINT 1 or SINT 2’ as appropriate.
• Start date and end date will be the 6-week period identified for improvement.
• Intended outcome will be titled SINT 1 (carefully thought sentence that reflects the problem 
to be overcome e.g. SINT 1 – Manage behaviour effectively to ensure a good and safe 
learning environment).
• Description will be a description of the problem, detail the plan of action to address the 
issue(s), detail any interim targets.
• Resources will detail any additional resources that will be required e.g. a mentor.
• Notes are a place where the line manager and the employee can add notes each time there 
is a related activity. Log any related good practice seen.
• End of process is where the outcome is logged.
6.4 Initial Teacher Training
6.4.1 Philosophy
The core philosophy of initial teacher training at Holy Trinity School is to develop new entrants to the 
profession, who have the ability to inspire our students with their subject knowledge, delivered 
through challenging and engaging teaching strategies. Student teachers will be immersed in the 
ethos of our school and build up positive relationships with both colleagues and students. Using 
positive behaviour for learning strategies and an awareness of data, student teachers will learn to 
become skilled and experienced classroom leaders.
6.4.2 Aims
It is our aim to work in co-operation with three key Initial Teacher Training providers in order to
educate the next generation of teachers so that the teachers who train with us are:
• Highly committed to their students learning and ambitious in what they want to help them 
achieve
• Inquisitive, critically reflective and motivated to keep learning and improving their own 
practice
• Quick to adapt to different learning contexts and confident to challenge inequalities;
• An asset to the profession, willing to share their knowledge and experience and to 
collaborate with others
• Well prepared for the realities of teaching, with the confidence, resilience, and skills to be 
innovative, to take risks and be creative
10
The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School - Staff Handbook – Section 6 - September 2025
6.4.3 Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE)
We will be a partner school during the academic year 2024/25 working with:
• University of Brighton
• University of Sussex
• University of Chichester
Although the one-year PGCE is referred to as a university-based course, students spend most of their 
time in school. In total, 24 weeks are spent on placement while 12 weeks are spent at university.
6.4.4 School Direct
We have joined with six other secondary schools and are part of a new alliance – The Oriel ITT (Initial 
Teacher Training) Partnership – this group will manage local School Direct provision in collaboration 
with the University of Brighton. 
The School Direct route is the youngest of the teacher training routes and was introduced in 2012 to 
give schools the chance to train teachers in subjects where there are shortages. Our School Direct 
trainees will be with us for the whole academic year. They will work alongside colleagues in their 
respective departments, spend time at university and complete a short placement at a neighbouring 
school.
6.4.5 Teacher Apprenticeship
We work with The National Institute of Teaching and Education through Coventry University to 
provide an apprenticeship route to QTS qualification. Apprenticeship trainee teachers follow a route 
where they are with the school for most of the year. There is a six-week placement at another school 
(contrasting context) in the spring term. Apprentices complete their pedagogy part on the course 
through online sessions delivered by Coventry University.
6.4.6 Mentoring
Every student teacher will have a designated mentor who will be trained annually by the Initial 
Teacher Training provider. Each week they will set aside a 1.5 hours session to provide the student 
teacher with uninterrupted, quality mentoring. In addition to this, the student teacher will have 
access to good practice across the school and all staff should be willing to make a valuable 
contribution to the development of these new entrants to the profession thus extending the 
mentoring role beyond the designated mentor.
6.5 Early Career Teachers
All early career teachers are required to complete a statutory induction period of two years. 
Statutory induction is the bridge between initial teacher training and a career in teaching. It 
combines a personalised programme of development, support and professional dialogue with 
monitoring and an assessment of performance against the relevant Teachers’ Standards. The 
programme should support the early career teacher (ECT) in demonstrating that their performance 
against all of the Teacher Standards is satisfactory by the end of the period and equip them with the 
tools to be an effective and successful teacher.

The Holy Trinity C of E Secondary School - Staff Handbook – Section 6 - September 2025
6.5.1 Ensuring a reduced timetable
An ECT will have a reduced timetable, when compared to the school’s existing teachers on the pay
range, to enable them to undertake activities in their induction programme. This works out as 90% of
a teacher's timetable in year 1 and 95% in year 2. This is in addition to the timetable reduction in 
respect of planning, preparation, and assessment time (PPA) that all teachers receive.
6.5.2 Monitoring, support, and assessment during induction
A suitable monitoring and support programme is put in place for the ECT in accordance with the 
statutory guidelines which commenced in September 2021. The Holy Trinity programme will be 
provided by Teach First and will be delivered by the Xavier Catholic Education Trust or National 
Society for Education via UCL. It will include:
• Support, guidance and the delivery of the prescribed two-year training programme by both 
an Induction Tutor and an Induction Mentor
• of the ECT, follow-up discussion and regular mentoring sessions (one hour per week in year 1 
and one hour per fortnight in year 2) by the induction mentor.
• Regular professional reviews of progress.
• ECTs observation of experienced teachers and engagement with the training programme
6.5.3 Observation of the ECT’s teaching practice
An ECT’s teacher will be observed at regular intervals throughout their induction period to facilitate a 
fair and effective assessment of the ECTs teaching practice, conduct and efficiency against the 
relevant standards. There will be a minimum of six observations during the two-year induction 
period. This equates to three observations per year – one per term. Each observation should be 
followed with prompt and constructive feedback.
6.5.4 Formal assessments
• Formal assessment points are scheduled to take place midway through induction (at the end 
of term 3) and one at the end of induction (at the end of term 6). These will be carried out by 
the induction tutor and senior leaders.
• Professional progress reviews will be required at the end of terms 1, 2, 4 and 5. The 
Appropriate Body (currently Xavier Teaching Hub and going forward, The Flourishing ECT 
Programme delivered with the Church of England Education Foundation and UCL)) is to 
receive and be informed as to whether the ECT is making satisfactory progress. These will be 
carried out by the induction tutor.
• Evidence for these reviews will be from teaching observations and their work as a teacher. 
Development targets will be reviewed, and a short-written record will be required.
• ECTS who are not making required progress against teaching standards will be placed on to a 
support plan and then a cause for concern plan if necessary. Both plans are run through 
Xavier.
• ECTs should be kept up to date on their progress and there should be no surprises.

MAIN RANGE (M1-6) PROGRESSION 
a. Meeting the teaching standards is a baseline requirement. Our Job Descriptions have been 
revised and updated to reflect this 
b. The overall performance of teachers will be judged on a best ‘best fit’ basis, i.e. the majority 
(i.e. 2) of judgements will prevail as the overall performance indicator. If differing evaluations 
are given across the 3 areas then the average - will be the one we use 
c. This approach is intended to allow for teachers to miss the ‘odd target’ or have an observation 
or evaluation ‘capture’ that doesn’t ‘come off’ and still their overall performance to be 
evaluated at an appropriate level 
d. The New (2012) Professional Standards, the HTS Main Scale Job Description and the HTS Career 
Stage Descriptors are the three key documents in terms of establishing the baseline for the 
‘teaching standards’ section. 
e. Teachers whose performance falls below the expected standard will join our Supportive 
Intervention programme aimed at supporting teachers to improve performance. See Appendix 
6 
f. If there is secure evidence that all criteria in row 1 “Exceeding standard / Exceptional 
Performance - Outstanding” are met in full then this colleague may apply for a double jump 
at the Interim Review and/or to be considered for movement onto the next Career Stage 
(subject to compliance with UPR application process). 
All teachers on the main scale progress up 1 point per year automatically.
